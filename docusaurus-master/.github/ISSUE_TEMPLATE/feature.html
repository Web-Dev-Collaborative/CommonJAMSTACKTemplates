  What happens if you skip this step?

  Someone will read your feature proposal and maybe will be able to help you,
  but itâ€™s unlikely that it will get much attention from the team. Eventually,
  the issue will likely get closed in favor of issues that have better explanations

  Thanks for helping us help you!
