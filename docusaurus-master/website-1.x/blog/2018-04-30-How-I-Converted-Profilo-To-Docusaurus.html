          PR with the addition so you can take a look and see if you like it.

      This is the story of the rather short journey it took to create the
      <a href="https://facebookincubator.github.io/profilo/">Profilo</a> website
      using Docusaurus.
    </p>
    <p>
      Profilo, an Android library for collecting performance traces from
      production,
      <a
        href="https://code.fb.com/android/profilo-understanding-app-performance-in-the-wild/"
        >was announced</a
      >
      earlier this year. The project was
      <a
        href="https://github.com/facebookincubator/profilo/tree/802042f90f990998a272387e371b893af52465b8"
        >published on GitHub</a
      >
      with a less than
      <a
        href="https://github.com/facebookincubator/profilo/tree/802042f90f990998a272387e371b893af52465b8/docs"
        >a handful or Markdown files</a
      >
      to describe its functionality and no website to showcase any branding and
      highlight the logo. The task at hand was to turn these existing docs and
      logo into a website.
    </p>

      In general, when creating a website with Docusaurus you do the following:
    </p>
    <ol type="1">
      <li>Generate a template website using Docusaurus scripts.</li>
      <li>
        Customize the generated template files for your desired site colors and
        your project configuration (ex: website and GitHub links).
      </li>
      <li>
        Create the website content:
        <ol type="1">
          <li>Add your docs and any supporting assets.</li>
          <li>
            Customize the default landing page provided by Docusaurus to suit
            your needs.
          </li>
          <li>Configure the default site navigation file.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>
        Publish the website and set up how it will be published for future
        changes.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Given I had pre-existing Markdown files, I didn’t have to generate the
      core content but simply make sure that Docusaurus could process the files
      by adding the expected metadata to them. Most of the work would therefore
      consist of customizing the defaults provided by Docusaurus.
    </p>
    <h2 id="overview-of-steps-taken">Overview of Steps Taken</h2>
    <p>
      Here’s an overview of the steps taken to convert to a website. I’ll
      discuss some of the design aspects in a later section.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Design and colors:</strong></p>
    <ol type="1">
      <li>
        Got all the desired logo formats from designer. I had to create the
        <em>.favicon</em> one.
      </li>
      <li>
        Worked out some passable primary and secondary website colors using the
        http://paletton.com/ tools - very handy!
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>Initial website setup:</strong></p>
    <ol type="1">
      <li>
        Forked the
        <a href="https://github.com/facebookincubator/profilo/"
          >Profilo project</a
        >
        on GitHub and created a local clone of the fork to set up the website.
      </li>
      <li>
        Created the initial Docusaurus website using the
        <a href="https://v1.docusaurus.io/docs/en/installation.html"
          >installation instructions</a
        >.
      </li>
      <li>
        Deleted the <code>docs-examples-from-docusaurus</code> and
        <code>website/blog-examples-from-docusaurus</code> folders as these
        would not be needed. Profilo had existing docs we could use and there
        was no need for blogs at this time.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>Content creation:</strong></p>
    <ol type="1">
      <li>
        <p>
          Added metadata to the existing Markdown files found in the
          <code>docs</code> folder, for example:
        </p>
        <pre><code>+---
+id: architecture
+title: Architecture
+sidebar_label: Architecture
+---</code></pre>
      </li>
      <li>
        Added the logo assets to the <code>website/static/img</code> folder.
      </li>
      <li>
        Modified <code>website/pages/en/index.js</code>, the landing page, to
        highlight Profilo features.
      </li>
      <li>
        Modified <code>website/core/Footer.js</code>, the footer, to simplify it
        for Profilo.
      </li>
      <li>
        Edited <code>website/siteConfig.js</code> (website configuration file)
        to specify the previously chosen primary and secondary colors.
      </li>
      <li>
        Modified <code>website/sidebars.json</code> that specifies the sidebar
        navigation. Listed all the docs and customized it based on the metadata
        added to the Markdown files.
      </li>
      <li>
        Edited the website configuration file to specify the GitHub properties,
        logo images, header links, and the website link.
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Tested the website locally throughout this phase. (I ran
          <code>yarn start</code> from the <code>website</code> folder to start
          the server.)
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>Feedback and review changes:</strong></p>
    <ol type="1">
      <li>
        Sent a
        <a href="https://github.com/facebookincubator/profilo/pull/6"
          >pull request</a
        >
        to the project.
      </li>
      <li>
        Updated the colors after the designer rightly gasped at the ones I had
        chosen (IANAD).
      </li>
      <li>Updated the colors and updated the PR.</li>
      <li>
        The PR was then accepted and
        <a
          href="https://github.com/facebookincubator/profilo/commit/6ad033aaf5a7d54e6d842f45a5bccd051a8e45ad"
          >merged</a
        >. Yay!
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>Website publishing:</strong></p>
    <ol type="1">
      <li>
        <p>
          Pushed the first website version by running the Docusaurus publish
          script from the command line:
        </p>
        <pre><code>USE_SSH=true \
  GIT_USER=caabernathy \
  CURRENT_BRANCH=master \
  yarn run publish-gh-pages</code></pre>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Configured CircleCI using the
          <a
            href="https://v1.docusaurus.io/docs/en/publishing.html#automating-deployments-using-continuous-integration"
            >provided Docusaurus instructions</a
          >. There were 2 PRs for this,
          <a href="https://github.com/facebookincubator/profilo/pull/8"
            >the first</a
          >for the initial config and
          <a href="https://github.com/facebookincubator/profilo/pull/12"
            >the second</a
          >
          to make sure CircleCI only triggered for changes in the master branch
          (thanks Joel Marcey!).
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      The final website was published on
      https://facebookincubator.github.io/profilo/. It had taken 1.5 hours to
      get to the initial PR stage and another half an hour or so to respond to
      review feedback and publish the website.
    </p>
    <h2 id="design">Design</h2>
    <p>
      Here’s what the initial website looked like when the first pull request
      was sent out:
    </p>
    <figure>
      <img
        src="/img/profilo_blog_post_website_initial.png"
        alt="Website Initial Design"
      />
      <figcaption>Website Initial Design</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      Most of the time in the content creation was spent picking colors that
      worked reasonably well with the given logo. These colors were a good
      jumping off point for designer feedback. I used Photoshop to sample
      various portions of the logo.
    </p>
    <figure>
      <img
        src="/img/profilo_blog_post_photoshop_color_picker.png"
        alt="Picking Color Photoshop"
      />
      <figcaption>Picking Color Photoshop</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      I then took the RGB representation of the color and set it as the baseline
      color on <a href="http://paletton.com/">Paletton</a>. The website then
      gave me various color options to try on the website by editing the
      Docusaurus website configuration file.
    </p>
    <figure>
      <img
        src="/img/profilo_blog_post_palette_website_color_picker.png"
        alt="Picking Color Paletton"
      />
      <figcaption>Picking Color Paletton</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      The selected primary and secondary colors were a good jumping off point
      for designer feedback.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were also modifications made to the default website generated by
      Docusaurus. These changes were mainly around simplifying the footer and
      creating a customized landing page for Profilo that listed the project’s
      features.
    </p>
    <p>Here’s what the final website looked like:</p>
    <figure>
      <img
        src="/img/profilo_blog_post_website_final.png"
        alt="Website Final Design"
      />
      <figcaption>Website Final Design</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      This is an example page showing the core content, in this case the Getting
      Started page:
    </p>
    <figure>
      <img
        src="/img/profilo_blog_post_website_final_docs.png"
        alt="Website Docs Example"
      />
      <figcaption>Website Docs Example</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      This also shows the sidebar structure that was set up through editing
      <code>website/sidebars.json</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lastly, I didn’t have to worry about handling responsive design. You get
      this out of the box with Docusaurus!
    </p>
    <figure>
      <img src="/img/profilo_blog_post_android_ios.png" alt="Mobile Site" />
      <figcaption>Mobile Site</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <h2 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h2>
    <p>
      The Profilo engineers were happy to see that they didn’t have to change
      their workflow to update existing content. They were able to continue
      working with Markdown files. This will still be true in the future if new
      docs are added, although there may be some config changes needed if the
      sidebar navigation needs to be updated.
    </p>
    <p>
      The infrastructure provided by Docusaurus made it easy to convert Markdown
      files into a working website. Even though the project had only three docs,
      this gave Profilo a more professional look. So, it was well worth the
      short time investment to get it done.
