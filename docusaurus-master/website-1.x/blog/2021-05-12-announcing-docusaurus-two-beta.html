      After a lengthy alpha stage in order to ensure feature parity and quality,
      we are excited to officially release the first

      >.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the announcement of this beta, the team is even more confident that
      Docusaurus 2 is <strong>ready for mainstream adoption</strong>!

    <p>Docusaurus 2 is widely adopted and growing fast:</p>

      Why was Docusaurus v2 in alpha for so long?
    </h2>
    <p>
      Itâ€™s hard to believe that the first alpha release
      <a
        href="https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/releases/tag/v2.0.0-alpha.0"
        >v2.0.0-alpha.0</a
      >
      was 2 years ago ðŸ˜³ , unusually long for a software alpha.
    </p>
    <p>
      As this was a substantial re-architecture of the code base, we wanted to
      ensure that we had confidence in the stability and features of Docusaurus
      2 before moving on to a beta stage, since beta suggests a high level of
      quality. We are happy to say that Docusaurus 2 has reached
      <strong>feature parity</strong> with Docusaurus 1 with
      <strong
        ><a
          href="https://docusaurus.io/blog/2021/03/09/releasing-docusaurus-i18n"
          >i18n</a
        ></strong
      >, and it has been <strong>successfully adopted</strong> by many
      Docusaurus sites (see
      <a href="https://docusaurus.io/showcase?tags=i18n">i18n showcase</a>).
    </p>
    <p>
      Weâ€™re now quite confident that the core features of Docusaurus 2 are
      stable enough to be in beta.
    </p>
    <h2 id="what-are-the-goals-of-the-beta">What are the goals of the beta?</h2>
    <p>
      Now that Docusaurus 2 is stable and major feature complete, the goal of
      the beta is to inspire confidence in new users on the production-readiness
      of Docusaurus 2, migrate more remaining Docusaurus 1 users to version 2,
      and officially deprecate Docusaurus 1. We will, of course, continue to
      resolve any issues and bugs that may be discovered.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition, we will use the beta phase to
      <strong>improve our theming system</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>We want to make it:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>easier to implement a custom theme</strong>, including for
          ourselves. We want to provide
          <a href="https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/issues/3522"
            >multiple official themes</a
          >
          (including
          <a href="https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/issues/2961"
            >Tailwind CSS</a
          >) for a long time.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>safer to extend an existing theme</strong>: it can be painful
          to upgrade a highly customized Docusaurus site, as customizations can
          conflict with internal changes. We need to make the theme public API
          surface more explicit, and make it clear what is safe to customize.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      We will build a better <strong>theming infrastructure</strong> and
      refactor the classic theme to use it.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you customize your site, you may find these planned improvements quite
      valuable.
    </p>
    <h2 id="whats-new">Whatâ€™s new?</h2>
    <p>In case you missed it, we recently shipped two major improvements:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href="https://docusaurus.io/docs/sidebar#sidebar-item-autogenerated"
          >Auto-generated sidebars</a
        >: no need to maintain a <code>sidebars.js</code> file anymore!
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/issues/4027"
          >Webpack 5 / PostCSS 8</a
        >: persistent caching significantly speeds up
        <strong>rebuild time</strong>!
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="whats-next">Whatâ€™s next?</h2>
    <p>Shipping the official 2.0 release!</p>
    <p>
      To get there, we will continue to <strong>fix bugs</strong> and implement
      the <strong>most wanted features</strong>, including:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href="https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/issues/2643"
          >Sidebar category index pages</a
        >

      <li>
        <a href="https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/issues/2220"
          >Better mobile navigation UX</a
        >

    <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
    <p>This is an exciting time for Docusaurus.</p>
    <p>
      We are inspired by the

      about Docusaurus, and discover new sites online every single day.
    </p>
    <p>
      We are so excited for this beta release. We strove for quality and
      stability while continuing to try to increase the adoption of Docusaurus.
      For those that have been on the fence from migrating an existing
      Docusaurus site to Docusaurus 2, it is a great time to upgrade. We want
      you running on the latest infrastructure when we deprecate Docusaurus 1 at
      the end of this beta period. Let us know how we can help.

      Thank you to everyone for reading and to the entire community who supports
      Docusaurus. ðŸ¤—
