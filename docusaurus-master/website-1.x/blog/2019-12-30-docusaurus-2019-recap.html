      2019 was a great year for Docusaurus - weâ€™ve made tremendous progress on
      <a href="https://docusaurus.io/">Docusaurus 2</a>. Current Docusaurus 1
      users who arenâ€™t using the translations feature can feel free to check it
      out and <a href="https://docusaurus.io/docs/migration">migrate</a> to it!
      Otherwise we will work with you to make that happen in 2020 :)
    </p>

    <h2 id="docusaurus-2-d2">Docusaurus 2 (D2)</h2>
    <p>
      In 2018, we proposed to rebuild
      <a href="https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/issues/789"
        >Docusaurus from the ground up</a
      >. It involved a major rearchitecture effort - we created a
      content-centric CSS framework from scratch, a plugins system, and moved
      from static HTML pages to be a single page-app with prerendered routes. It
      was a wild adventure and a tough feat, especially with no dedicated FTE
      working on the project. With the help of
      <span class="citation" data-cites="endilie">[@endilie]</span
      >(https://github.com/endiliey), our
      ex-intern-turned-contributor-turned-maintainer, we made really good
      progress on D2 and are currently on version 2.0.0-alpha.40. All features
      in Docusaurus 1 except for translations have been ported over.
    </p>
    <p>
      D2â€™s killer features are <strong>Dark Mode</strong> and its
      <strong>superb performance</strong>. D2 has dark mode support
      out-of-the-box and it is near effortless to create a dark mode-friendly
      documentation site. Endilie put in great effort into optimizing the
      performance of the site and a bunch of performance optimization tricks
      have been done under the hood by default - optimized images, prerendering
      every route to static HTML and client-side routing thereafter, prefetching
      assets needed by future navigations whenever the user hovers over a
      navigation link, etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      Last but not least, we implemented a plugins architecture and turned the
      repo into a
      <a href="https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/tree/master/packages"
        >Lerna monorepo</a
      >. We believe this plugin architecture will be helpful towards building a
      community and also allowing users to build their own features for their
      unique use cases.

    <p>
      A good portion of the projects within the Open Source community use
      Docusaurus. This half we also onboarded more notable projects onto
      Docusaurus 2:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://create-react-app.dev/">Create React App</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://redux.js.org/">Redux</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://draftjs.org/">Draft.js</a></li>
      <li><a href="http://facebook.github.io/flux/">Flux</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p>And welcomed more projects to Docusaurus 1:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://developers.libra.org/">Libra</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://mobx.js.org/">MobX</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://immerjs.github.io/immer/">Immer</a></li>

      Yangshun gave a classroom session during F8 about
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGJsf6mgZE"
        >Using Docusaurus to Create Open Source Websites</a
      >.
    </p>
    <h2 id="community">Community</h2>
    <p>
      A few third-party hosting/development services also has first-class
      integration with a Docusaurus setup:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href="https://github.com/zeit/now-examples/tree/master/docusaurus"

    <h2 id="looking-ahead">Looking Ahead</h2>
    <p>
      D2 has gained some traction among the
      <a href="https://docusaurus.io/showcase">developer community</a>. In 2020,
      we want to achieve full feature parity with D1 by the first half and help
      the remaining Facebook projects on D1 move to D2. It would also be great
      if we could use Docusaurus for internal documentation, but that is a
      non-trivial undertaking. If you have a need for it or have some ideas,
      come speak with us!
