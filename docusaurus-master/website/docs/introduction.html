      <strong>single-page application</strong> with a fast client-side
      navigation, leveraging the full power of <strong>React</strong> to make
      your site interactive. It provides out-of-the-box
      <strong>documentation features</strong>, but can be used to create
      <strong>any kind of site</strong> (personal website, product, blog,

          >PRPL Pattern</a
        >
        that makes sure your content loads blazing fast
      </li>
      <li>
        ü¶ñ <strong>Accessible</strong> - Attention to accessibility, making your
        site equally accessible to all users
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="design-principles">Design principles</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Little to learn</strong> - Docusaurus should be easy to learn
        and use as the API is quite small. Most things will still be achievable
        by users, even if it takes them more code and more time to write. Not
        having abstractions is better than having the wrong abstractions, and we
        don‚Äôt want users to have to hack around the wrong abstractions.
        Mandatory talk -
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4anAwXYqLG8"
          >Minimal API Surface Area</a
        >.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Intuitive</strong> - Users will not feel overwhelmed when
        looking at the project directory of a Docusaurus project or adding new
        features. It should look intuitive and easy to build on top of, using
        approaches they are familiar with.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Layered architecture</strong> - The separations of concerns
        between each layer of our stack (content/theming/styling) should be
        clear - well-abstracted and modular.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Sensible defaults</strong> - Common and popular performance
        optimizations and configurations will be done for users but they are
        given the option to override them.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>No vendor-lock in</strong> - Users are not required to use the
        default plugins or CSS, although they are highly encouraged to. Certain
        core lower-level infra level pieces like React Loadable, React Router
        cannot be swapped because we do default performance optimization on
        them. But not higher level ones, such as choice of Markdown engines, CSS
        frameworks, CSS methodology will be entirely up to users.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      We believe that as developers, knowing how a library works is helpful in
      allowing us to become better at using it. Hence we‚Äôre dedicating effort
      into explaining the architecture and various components of Docusaurus with
      the hope that users reading it will gain a deeper understanding of the
      tool and be even more proficient in using it.

    <h2 id="comparison-with-other-tools">Comparison with other tools</h2>
    <p>
      Across all static site generators, Docusaurus has a unique focus on
      documentation sites and has many out-of-the-box features.
    </p>
    <p>
      We‚Äôve also studied other main static site generators and would like to
      share our insights on the comparison, hopefully to help you navigate
      through the prismatic choices out there.
    </p>
    <h3 id="gatsby">Gatsby</h3>
    <p>
      <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.com/">Gatsby</a> is packed with a lot of
      features, has a rich ecosystem of plugins and is capable of doing
      everything that Docusaurus does. Naturally, that comes at a cost of a
      higher learning curve. Gatsby does many things well and is suitable for
      building many types of websites. On the other hand, Docusaurus tries to do
      one thing super well - be the best tool for writing and publishing
      content.
    </p>
    <p>
      GraphQL is also pretty core to Gatsby, although you don‚Äôt necessarily need
      GraphQL to build a Gatsby site. In most cases when building static
      websites, you won‚Äôt need the flexibility that GraphQL provides.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many aspects of Docusaurus 2 were inspired by the best things about Gatsby
      and it‚Äôs a great alternative.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a href="https://github.com/pedronauck/docz">Dokz</a> is a Gatsby theme to
      build documentation website. It is currently less featured than
      Docusaurus.
    </p>
    <h3 id="nextjs">Next.js</h3>
    <p>
      <a href="https://nextjs.org/">Next.js</a> is another very popular hybrid
      React framework. It can help you build a good documentation website, but
      it is not opinionated toward the documentation use-case, and it will
      require a lot more work to implement what Docusaurus provides
      out-of-the-box.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a href="https://github.com/shuding/nextra">Nextra</a> is an opinionated
      static-site-generator built on top of Next.js. It is currently less
      featured than Docusaurus.
    </p>
    <h3 id="vuepress">VuePress</h3>
    <p>
      <a href="https://vuepress.vuejs.org/">VuePress</a> has many similarities
      with Docusaurus - both focus heavily on content-centric website and
      provides tailored documentation features out of the box. However, VuePress
      is powered by Vue, while Docusaurus is powered by React. If you want a
      Vue-based solution, VuePress would be a decent choice.
    </p>
    <h3 id="mkdocs">MkDocs</h3>
    <p>
      <a href="https://www.mkdocs.org/">MkDocs</a> is a popular Python
      static-site-generator with value proposition similar to Docusaurus.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is a good option if you don‚Äôt need a single-page application, and don‚Äôt
      plan to leverage React.
    </p>

    <h3 id="docsify">Docsify</h3>
    <p>
      <a href="https://docsify.js.org/">Docsify</a> makes it easy to create a
      documentation website, but is not a static-site generator and is not SEO
      friendly.
    </p>
    <h3 id="gitbook">GitBook</h3>
    <p>
      <a href="https://www.gitbook.com/">GitBook</a> has very clean design and
      has been used by many open source projects. With its focus shifting
      towards a commercial product rather than an open-source tool, many of its
      requirements no longer fit the needs as an open source project‚Äôs
      documentation site. As a result, many have turned to other products. You
      may read about Redux‚Äôs switch to Docusaurus
      <a href="https://github.com/reduxjs/redux/issues/3161">here</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Currently, GitBook is only free for open-source and non-profit teams.
      Docusaurus is free for everyone.
    </p>
    <h3 id="jekyll">Jekyll</h3>
    <p>
      <a href="https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll">Jekyll</a> is one of the most
      mature static site generators around and has been a great tool to use ‚Äî in
      fact, before Docusaurus, most of Facebook‚Äôs Open Source websites are/were
      built on Jekyll! It is extremely simple to get started. We want to bring a
      similar developer experience as building a static site with Jekyll.
    </p>
    <p>
      In comparison with statically generated HTML and interactivity added using
      <code>&lt;script /&gt;</code> tags, Docusaurus sites are React apps. Using
      modern JavaScript ecosystem tooling, we hope to set new standards on doc
      sites performance, asset build pipeline and optimizations, and ease to
      setup.

      For new feature requests, you can create a post on our
      <a href="/feedback">Canny board</a>, which is a handy tool for roadmapping
      and allows for sorting by upvotes, which gives the core team a better
      indicator of what features are in high demand, as compared to GitHub
      issues which are harder to triage. Refrain from making a Pull Request for
      new features (especially large ones) as someone might already be working
      on it or will be part of our roadmap. Talk to us first!
