        <strong>Little to learn</strong> - Docusaurus should be easy to learn
        and use as the API is quite small. Most things will still be achievable
        by users, even if it takes them more code and more time to write. Not
        having abstractions is better than having the wrong abstractions, and we
        don’t want users to have to hack around the wrong abstractions.
        Mandatory talk -

          >Minimal API Surface Area</a
        >.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Intuitive</strong> - Users will not feel overwhelmed when
        looking at the project directory of a Docusaurus project or adding new
        features. It should look intuitive and easy to build on top of, using
        approaches they are familiar with.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Layered architecture</strong> - The separations of concerns
        between each layer of our stack (content/theming/styling) should be
        clear - well-abstracted and modular.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Sensible defaults</strong> - Common and popular performance
        optimizations and configurations will be done for users but they are
        given the option to override them.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>No vendor-lock in</strong> - Users are not required to use the
        default plugins or CSS, although they are highly encouraged to. Certain
        core lower-level infra level pieces like React Loadable, React Router
        cannot be swapped because we do default performance optimization on
        them. But not higher level ones, such as choice of Markdown engines, CSS
        frameworks, CSS methodology will be entirely up to users.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="how-docusaurus-works">How Docusaurus works</h2>
    <!-- moved in from how Docusaurus works @yangshun -->
    <p>
      We believe that as developers, knowing how a library works is helpful in
      allowing us to become better at using it. Hence we’re dedicating effort
      into explaining the architecture and various components of Docusaurus with
      the hope that users reading it will gain a deeper understanding of the
      tool and be even more proficient in using it.
