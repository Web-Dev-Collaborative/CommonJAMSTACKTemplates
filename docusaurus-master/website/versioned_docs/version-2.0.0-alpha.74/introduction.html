      Docusaurus v2 is <strong>still alpha</strong> (since mid-2019) but already
      quite stable.
    </p>
    <p>
      We highly encourage you to
      <strong>use Docusaurus v2 over Docusaurus v1</strong>.

      Docusaurus 1 used to be a pure documentation site generator. In Docusaurus
      2, we rebuilt it from the ground up, allowing for more customizability but
      preserved the best parts of Docusaurus 1 - easy to get started, versioned
      docs, and i18n (<em>coming soon</em>).
    </p>
    <p>
      Beyond that, Docusaurus 2 is a
      <strong>performant static site generator</strong> and can be used to
      create common content-driven websites (e.g.¬†Documentation, Blogs, Product
      Landing and Marketing Pages, etc) extremely quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      While our main focus will still be helping you get your documentations
      right and well, it is possible to build any kind of website using
      Docusaurus 2 as it is just a React application.
      <strong
        >Docusaurus can now be used to build any website, not just documentation
        websites.</strong

    <h2 id="comparison-with-other-tools">Comparison with other tools</h2>
    <p>
      Across all static site generators, Docusaurus has a unique focus on doc
      sites and has out-of-the-box structure you need.
    </p>
    <p>
      We‚Äôve also studied other main static site generators and would like to
      share our insights on the comparison, hopefully to help you navigate
      through the prismatic choices out there.
    </p>
    <h3 id="gatsby">Gatsby</h3>
    <p>
      Gatsby is packed with a lot of features, has a rich ecosystem of plugins
      and is capable of doing everything that Docusaurus does. Naturally, that
      comes at a cost of a higher learning curve. Gatsby does many things well
      and is suitable for building many types of websites. On the other hand,
      Docusaurus tries to do one thing super well - be the best tool for writing
      and publishing content.
    </p>
    <p>
      GraphQL is also pretty core to Gatsby, although you don‚Äôt necessarily need
      GraphQL to build a Gatsby site. In most cases when building static
      websites, you won‚Äôt need the flexibility that GraphQL provides.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many aspects of Docusaurus 2 were inspired by the best things about Gatsby
      and it‚Äôs a great alternative.
    </p>
    <h3 id="gitbook">GitBook</h3>
    <p>
      GitBook has very clean design and has been used by many open source
      projects. With its focus shifting towards a commercial product rather than
      an open-source tool, many of its requirements no longer fit the needs as
      an open source project‚Äôs documentation site. As a result, many have turned
      to other products. You may read about Redux‚Äôs switch to Docusaurus
      <a href="https://github.com/reduxjs/redux/issues/3161">here</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Currently, GitBook is only free for open-source and non-profit teams.
      Docusaurus is free for everyone.
    </p>
    <h3 id="jekyll">Jekyll</h3>
    <p>
      Jekyll is one of the most mature static site generators around and has
      been a great tool to use ‚Äî in fact, before Docusaurus, most of Facebook‚Äôs
      Open Source websites are/were built on Jekyll! It is extremely simple to
      get started. We want to bring a similar developer experience as building a
      static site with Jekyll.
    </p>
    <p>
      In comparison with statically generated HTML and interactivity added using
      <code>&lt;script /&gt;</code> tags, Docusaurus sites are React apps. Using
      modern JavaScript ecosystem tooling, we hope to set new standards on doc
      sites performance, asset build pipeline and optimizations, and ease to
      setup.
    </p>
    <h3 id="vuepress">VuePress</h3>
    <p>
      VuePress has many similarities with Docusaurus - both focus heavily on
      content-centric website and provides tailored documentation features out
      of the box. However, VuePress is powered by Vue, while Docusaurus is
      powered by React. If you want a Vue-based solution, VuePress would be a
      decent choice.
