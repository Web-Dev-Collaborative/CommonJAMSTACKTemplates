      This page explains how migrate a translated Docusaurus v1 site to
      Docusaurus v2.
    </p>
    <h2 id="i18n-differences">i18n differences</h2>
    <p>
      Docusaurus v2 i18n is conceptually quite similar to Docusaurus v1 i18n
      with a few differences.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is not tightly coupled to Crowdin, and you can use Git or another SaaS
      instead.
    </p>
    <h3 id="different-filesystem-paths">Different filesystem paths</h3>
    <p>
      On Docusaurus v2, localized content is generally found at
      <code>website/i18n/&lt;locale&gt;</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Docusaurus v2 is modular based on a plugin system, and each plugin is
      responsible to manage its own translations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each plugin has its own i18n subfolder, like:
      <code>website/i18n/fr/docusaurus-plugin-content-blog</code>
    </p>
    <h3 id="updated-translation-apis">Updated translation APIs</h3>
    <p>
      With Docusaurus v1, you translate your pages with
      <code>&lt;translate&gt;</code>:
    </p>
    <pre
      class="jsx"
    ><code>const translate = require(&#39;../../server/translate.js&#39;).translate;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;translate desc=&quot;the header description&quot;&gt;
    This header will be translated
  &lt;/translate&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;;</code></pre>
    <p>
      On Docusaurus v2, you translate your pages with
      <code>&lt;Translate&gt;</code>
    </p>
    <pre
      class="jsx"
    ><code>import Translate from &#39;@docusaurus/Translate&#39;;

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;Translate id=&quot;header.translation.id&quot; description=&quot;the header description&quot;&gt;
    This header will be translated
  &lt;/Translate&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;;</code></pre>
    <div class="note">
      <p>
        The <code>write-translations</code> CLI still works to extract
        translations from your code.
      </p>
      <p>
        The code translations are now added to
        <code>i18n/&lt;lang&gt;/code.json</code> using Chrome i18n JSON format.
      </p>
    </div>
    <h3 id="stricter-markdown-parser">Stricter Markdown parser</h3>
    <p>
      Docusaurus v2 is using <a href="https://mdxjs.com/">MDX</a> to parse
      Markdown files.
    </p>
    <p>
      MDX compiles Markdown files to React components, is stricter than the
      Docusaurus v1 parser, and will make your build fail on error instead of
      rendering some bad content.
    </p>
    <p>Also, the HTML elements must be replaced by JSX elements.</p>
    <p>
      This is particularly important for i18n because if your translations are
      not good on Crowdin and use invalid Markup, your v2 translated site might
      fail to build: you may need to do some translation cleanup to fix the
      errors.
    </p>
    <h2 id="migration-strategies">Migration strategies</h2>
    <p>
      This section will help you figure out how to
      <strong>keep your existing v1 translations after you migrate to v2</strong
      >.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are <strong>multiple possible strategies</strong> to migrate a
      Docusaurus v1 site using Crowdin, with different tradeoffs.
    </p>
    <div class="caution">
      <p>
        This documentation is a best-effort to help you migrate, please help us
        improve it if you find a better way!
      </p>
    </div>
    <p>Before all, we recommend to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Migrate your v1 Docusaurus site to v2 without the translations</li>
      <li>
        Get familiar with the
        <a href="../i18n/i18n-introduction.md"

        an
      </li>
      <li>
        Make Crowdin work for your v2 site, using a new and untranslated Crowdin
        project and the <a href="../i18n/i18n-crowdin.mdx">Crowdin tutorial</a>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <div class="danger">
      <p>
        Don’t try to migrate without understanding both Crowdin and Docusaurus
        v2 i18n.
      </p>
    </div>
    <h3 id="create-a-new-crowdin-project">Create a new Crowdin project</h3>
    <p>
      To avoid any <strong>risk of breaking your v1 site in production</strong>,
      one possible strategy is to duplicate the original v1 Crowdin project.
    </p>
    <div class="info">
      <p>
        This strategy was used to
        <a href="https://jestjs.io/blog/2021/03/09/jest-website-upgrade"
          >upgrade the Jest website</a
        >.
      </p>
    </div>
    <p>
      Unfortunately, Crowdin does not have any “Duplicate/clone Project”
      feature, which makes things complicated.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Download the translation memory of your original project in
        <code>.tmx</code> format (<code
          >https://crowdin.com/project/&lt;ORIGINAL_PROJECT&gt;/settings#tm</code
        >
        &gt; <code>View Records</code>)
      </li>
      <li>
        Upload the translation memory to your new project (<code
          >https://crowdin.com/project/&lt;NEW_PROJECT&gt;/settings#tm</code
        >
        &gt; <code>View Records</code>)
      </li>
      <li>
        Reconfigure <code>crowdin.yml</code> for Docusaurus v2 according to the
        i18n docs
      </li>
      <li>
        Upload the Docusaurus v2 source files with the Crowdin CLI to the new
        project
      </li>
      <li>
        Mark sensitive strings like <code>id</code> or <code>slug</code> as
        “hidden string” on Crowdin
      </li>
      <li>
        On the “Translations” tab, click on “Pre-Translation &gt; via TM”
        (<code>https://crowdin.com/project/&lt;NEW_PROJECT&gt;/settings#translations</code>)
      </li>
      <li>
        Try first with “100% match” (more content will be translated than
        “Perfect”), and pre-translate your sources
      </li>
      <li>Download the Crowdin translations locally</li>
      <li>Try to run/build your site and see if there are any errors</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      You will likely have errors on your first-try: the pre-translation might
      try to translate things that it should not be translated (frontmatter,
      admonition, code blocks…), and the translated md files might be invalid
      for the MDX parser.
    </p>
    <p>
      You will have to fix all the errors until your site builds. You can do
      that by modifying the translated md files locally, and fix your site for
      one locale at a time using <code>docusaurus build --locale fr</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is no ultimate guide we could write to fix these errors, but common
      errors are due to:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Not marking enough strings as “hidden strings” in Crowdin, leading to
        pre-translation trying to translate these strings.
      </li>
      <li>
        Having bad v1 translations, leading to invalid markup in v2: bad html
        elements inside translations and unclosed tags
      </li>
      <li>
        Anything rejected by the MDX parser, like using HTML elements instead of
        JSX elements (use the
        <a href="https://mdxjs.com/playground/">MDX playground</a> for
        debugging)
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      You might want to repeat this pre-translation process, eventually trying
      the “Perfect” option and limiting pre-translation only some
      languages/files.
    </p>
    <div class="tip">
      <p>
        Use
        <a href="../i18n/i18n-crowdin.mdx#mdx-solutions"
          ><code>mdx-code-block</code></a
        >
        around problematic markdown elements: Crowdin is less likely mess things
        up with code blocks.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="note">
      <p>
        You will likely notice that some things were translated on your old
        project, but are now untranslated in your new project.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Crowdin Markdown parser is evolving other time and each Crowdin
        project has a different parser version, which can lead to
        pre-translation not being able to pre-translate all the strings.
      </p>
      <p>
        This parser version is undocumented, and you will have to ask the
        Crowdin support to know your project’s parser version and fix one
        specific version.
      </p>
      <p>
        Using the same cli version and parser version across the 2 Crowdin
        projects might give better results.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="danger">
      <p>
        Crowdin has an “upload translations” feature, but in our experience it
        does not give very good results for Markdown
      </p>
    </div>
    <h3 id="use-the-existing-crowdin-project">
      Use the existing Crowdin project
    </h3>
    <p>
      If you don’t mind modifying your existing Crowdin project and risking to
      mess things up, it may be possible to use the Crowdin branch system.
    </p>
    <div class="caution">
      <p>
        This workflow has not been tested in practice, please report us how good
        it is.
      </p>
    </div>
    <p>
      This way, you wouldn’t need to create a new Crowdin project, transfer the
      translation memory, apply pre-translations, and try to fix the
      pre-translations errors.
    </p>
    <p>
      You could create a Crowdin branch for Docusaurus v2, where you upload the
      v2 sources, and merge the Crowdin branch to master once ready.
    </p>
    <h3 id="use-git-instead-of-crowdin">Use Git instead of Crowdin</h3>
    <p>
      It is possible to migrate away of Crowdin, and add the translation files
      to Git instead.
    </p>
    <p>
      Use the Crowdin CLI to download the v1 translated files, and put these
      translated files at the correct Docusaurus v2 filesystem location.
