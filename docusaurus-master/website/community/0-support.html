    <h2 id="feature-requests">Feature requests</h2>
    <p>
      For new feature requests, you can create a post on our
      <a href="/feedback">Canny board</a>, which is a handy tool for roadmapping
      and allows for sorting by upvotes, which gives the core team a better
      indicator of what features are in high demand, as compared to GitHub
      issues which are harder to triage. Refrain from making a Pull Request for
      new features (especially large ones) as someone might already be working
      on it or will be part of our roadmap. Talk to us first!
