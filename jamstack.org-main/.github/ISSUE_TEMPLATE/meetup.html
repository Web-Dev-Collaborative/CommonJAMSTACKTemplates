        - If so, it would be worth joining and supporting that group before
        deciding to add another. And the organizers of Jamstack groups are
        likely to welcome some support.

        <strong>Organizing an official group takes some commitment</strong> -
        Weâ€™re so excited that youâ€™ve come this far, and we want you to succeed.
        We ask orgaizers to aim to hold meetings (physical or virtual) at least
        3 times a year.

        <strong>An online event space</strong> - Most groups use Meetup.com or
        Facebook to coordinate their events, but you can use a different tool of

        publicly on a neutral platform.

      <li>
        <strong>A published and actionable code of conduct</strong> - To help
        the community stay inclusive, safe, and welcoming.

    <h3 id="resource-kit">Resource kit</h3>
    <p>
      Weâ€™ll provide a resource kit with logos and branded assets for you to use.
      Weâ€™d like you to make use of the official Jamstack logo where
      approporiate, but donâ€™t let us stiffle your creativity. Some meetups have
      also added their own fun aesthetic and thatâ€™s great too.
    </p>
    <h3 id="links-and-listings">Links and listings</h3>
    <p>
      Weâ€™ll add a link to your events page to the
      <a href="https://jamstack.org/community">community section</a> of the
      official Jamstack site. And if you provide a feed of your upcoming and
      previous events, weâ€™ll also add your events to the listings.
    </p>
    <h3 id="community-and-support">Community and support</h3>
    <p>
      Each Jamstack community group gets their own channel in the
      <a href="https://jamstack.org/jamslack">Jamslack</a> to help coordindate
      your event and communicate with your local community.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can also speak to other group organizers and reach us for support via
      in the Jamslack as members of the private organizers admin channel.
    </p>
    <h3 id="code-of-conduct">Code of Conduct</h3>
    <p>
      We have <a href="">a boilerplate code of conduct</a> which you can use as
      a starting point. Please note that you will need to customise this for you
      and your group. It is vital that the information about how people can
      contact you and how action may be taken is correct for your group rather
      than being generic.
    </p>
    <h3 id="content-and-speakers">Content and speakers</h3>
    <p>
      Recruiting speakers and putting together compelling content can be one of
      the biggest challenges for User Group leaders. We encourage you to reach
      out to your fellow user group leaders via
      <a href="https://jamstack.org/slack">Slack</a> for ideas, and even
      consider partnering with them for virtual events or workshops.

    <h2 id="jamstack-conf">Jamstack Conf</h2>
    <p>
      <a href="https://jamstackconf.com">Jamstack Conf</a> is an annual event
      for the global Jamstack community and provides a great opportunity for
      local community groups to participate, apply for awards, and share their
      knowledge. Active Jamstack user group leaders receive special incentives
      and activities during this event, and weâ€™re keen to get them more involved
      in helping shape the event. You can
