    <h2 id="built-for-speed">Built for speed</h2>
    <p>
      Clicking is lame. With enduro.js, exactly zero clicks are necessary to
      build the whole project.
    </p>
    <h2 id="killer-admin-ui">Killer admin ui</h2>
    <p>
      Somebody non-technical will eventually manage content on the website. You
      might as well provide this person with awesome, beautiful, quick and
      simple experience.
    </p>
    <h2 id="blazing-fast">Blazing fast</h2>
    <p>
      Slow pageloads are the worst. Enduro pregenerates pages to provide the
      fastest possible response time. Coupled with direct uploading to cdn -
      can’t get any faster.
    </p>
    <h2 id="build-tool">Build tool</h2>
    <p>
      Sass check. Spritessheet generation check. Enduro.js comes with set of
      build tools to build everything on the server. Forget about ftping built
      files.
    </p>
    <h2 id="live-reload">Live reload</h2>
    <p>
      Enduro.js comes with browsersync build in and everything hooked up. Change
      the color in sass file - BOOM - 0.1 seconds later you see the new color in
      your browser.
    </p>
    <h2 id="code-separation">Code separation</h2>
    <p>
      Enduro.js is built around handlebars. Logiless templates. No way to
      spagetticode it now.
    </p>
    <h2 id="shared-templates">Shared templates</h2>
    <p>
      Html components written for backend are accessible to frontend’s
      javascript as well. Amazing.
    </p>
    <h2 id="isomorphic-javascript">Isomorphic javascript</h2>
    <p>
      Using javascript for both frontend and backend is just a great idea. With
      enduro.js, all your javascript modules can now be loaded by page
      generation, api and frontend code.
    </p>
    <h2 id="deploy-by-git">Deploy by git</h2>
    <p>
      What do you need to deploy the project? Git url. Thats it. Everything is
      set up. Server will build everything with enduro.js.
    </p>
    <h2 id="scalable">Scalable</h2>
    <p>
      Enduro.js projects are self-contained and ready to be web-scaled with push
      of a button.
    </p>
    <h2 id="flat-files">Flat files</h2>
    <p>
      No database. Just tiny flat files. Ready to be edited by your favorite
      text editor. Incredibly convenient, ready to be stored in git. No setup
      required.
    </p>
    <h2 id="rapid-api">Rapid api</h2>
    <p>
      Enduro comes with a simple framework built on top of express. Using raw
      power of node.js you can add mongodb or complex functionality to your
      website.
    </p>
    <h2 id="simple">Simple</h2>
    <p>
      Learning curve so flat it is actually going down. No setup, no magic.
      Enduro.js comes with a scaffolding to set you up and get you running
      quickly.
    </p>
    <h2 id="multilingual">Multilingual</h2>
    <p>
      So you are making a website that will be published in multiple languages?
      Built in. Out of the box. No setup.
    </p>
    <h2 id="open-source">Open source</h2>
    <p>
      Enduro.js is open-source and free to use. Distributed under the MIT
      License
    </p>
    <h2 id="good-parts">Good parts</h2>
    <p>
      Only the best ingredients were used when making Enduro. Handlebars, Sass,
      Gulp, Bootstrap, Angularjs, Browsersync, Express, Jasmine, Git, Npm and
      Heroku
