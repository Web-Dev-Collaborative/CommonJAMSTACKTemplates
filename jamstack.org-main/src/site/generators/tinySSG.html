      Tiny SSG is a static site generator built with Python. It can read
      markdown files, but it has also some interesting features for
      pre-processing the images.

      I made this tool for a client who wanted to turn his website into a static
      one, in order to improve the security and the performances. As the
      original site included more than 300 images, I needed to code something to
      process all of them in various sizes, and to implement a lazy loading.
