      I built Waffel because I missed a JavaScript static generator that
      featured:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>content localisation for different languages;</li>
      <li>grouping of entities by properties (categories/tags);</li>
      <li>pagination of collections;</li>
      <li>ease of writing custom template filters/helpers.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>

      skeleton in order to run a local example.

      <strong>Waffel</strong> was born as a simple script to generate
      <a href="http://www.diegocaponera.com/">my website</a> and a couple of
      <a href="http://www.shoegaze.it/">other</a>
      <a href="http://www.dreampop.it/">pages</a>, and eventually my company’s
      homepage. I thought it was worth releasing, basically because I plan to
      reuse it a lot in the close future, best as a companion to a content
      management tool I hope to release very soon.

      I think that having a full web stack for a blog/portfolio/small business
      showcase site is really an overkill today: you need a lot of services
      running in order to serve content, you will be the very only one to change
      in a deterministic way. Now that all our pathetic
      <code>comments.php</code> efforts have been teared apart by Disqus/social
      commenting facilities, why should we store our thoughts in a database,
      instead of on good ol’ text files, editable in the way we find more
      comfortable?
