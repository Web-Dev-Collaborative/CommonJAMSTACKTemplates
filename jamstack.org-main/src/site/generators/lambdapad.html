    <p>Lambda Pad can be used to generate a static site. Here’s the gist:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Maintain <em>data</em> in various formats</li>
      <li>Maintain <em>templates</em> and related <em>static content</em></li>
      <li>Use an Erlang module to generate a static site</li>
    </ul>
    <h1 id="why-another-tool">Why Another Tool?</h1>
    <p>
      It’s fair to say that static site generation
      <a href="http://staticsitegenerators.net">is a solved problem</a>. Why
      would anyone want to created yet another static site generator when there
      are so many well established, robust, proven tools already?
    </p>
    <p>
      Because the world <em>needs</em> a static site generator that embraces
      <em>functional thinking</em>. What does that mean?
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Behavior should be obvious, or as obvious as possible without excessive
        verbosity
      </li>
      <li>
        Users should not be stupefied and confused by implicit or otherwise
        magical behavior
      </li>
      <li>
        Solutions should be small and focused to make them easier to understand
        — in general, the principle of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns"
          >separation of concerns</a
        >
        should be evident when using the tool
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      When the goodness of functional thinking is applied to static site
      generation, users will have more fun and be more productive!

    <h1 id="why-erlang">Why Erlang?</h1>
    <p>
      Erlang is a simple, easy-to-learn functional language that’s incredibly
      powerful. It’s known for building highly reliable, massively scalable
      systems (<em
        >shout-out to WhatsApp — hey, what do you guys think of sponsoring a six
        week Lambda Pad sprint in Fiji?</em
      >) but it’s also terrific for tasks like site generation. Erlang

      is low-noise and expressive. Erlang

      are beautiful and maintainable.

      Erlang is also

      >!
    </p>
    <p>
      The question is not so much <em>Why Erlang</em>, but
      <em>Why Not Erlang</em>?
    </p>
    <p>
      Most static site generators use so called “human friendly” languages for
      configuration and customization. A few of the more popular options include
      YAML, JSON, Ruby, and Python. Lambda Pad will show that Erlang — yes,
      straight up <em>Erlang</em> — should be counted among the usual suspects
      for ease-of-use, clarity, and productivity!
