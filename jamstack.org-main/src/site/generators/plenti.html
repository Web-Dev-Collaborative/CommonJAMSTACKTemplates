    <p>
      Plenti is a static site generator with fast build times and a flexible
      frontend framework for designing ambitious user experiences. The CLI tool
      is written in Go, so it’s fast and is downloaded as a single binary that
      doesn’t require dependencies. The templating is done in Svelte so you can
      create an SPA with minimal overhead being sent to your browser and the
      syntax is easy to pick up for beginners.
    </p>
    <p>
      Routing is setup out-of-the-box based on your content source. You can
      override this by “ejecting” core files and customizing them to your
      liking.
    </p>
    <p>
      No bundler is needed, Plenti pulls in ESM support for your NPM
      dependencies.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every route gets an HTML fallback for better initial page load
      performance, a consistent experience with javascript disabled, and
      improved SEO. All endpoints automatically hydrate into an SPA.
    </p>
    <p>
      The local dev server automatically watches your project for changes and
      rebuilds so you can write code without having to restart anything.
    </p>
    <p>
      A flexible content source allows you to define whatever field structure
      you’d like, without any restrictions. There are no required or protected
      keys.
