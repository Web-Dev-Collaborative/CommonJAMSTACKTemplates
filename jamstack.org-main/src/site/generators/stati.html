      Stati is an extensible PHP static site generator that can generate your
      existing Jekyll sites.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jekyll is one of the most popular static site generator, but unfortunately
      for those of us not proficient in ruby, it cannot be extended that easily.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stati solves that, with itâ€™s clear plugin architecture based on the
      Symfony Event Dispatcher component, your plugin can hook at various points
      in the site generation lifecycle to modify the output any way you can
      dream of.
    </p>
    <p>
      Built on Symfony components, it is robust, and while not as fast as
      Jekyll, it should be bearable for most purposes.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is still at an early stage of develompent, but it should already be
      able to build most Jekyll sites.
