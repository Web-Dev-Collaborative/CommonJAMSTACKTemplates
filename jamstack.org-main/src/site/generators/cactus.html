      Cactus is a simple but powerful
      <a href="https://davidwalsh.name/introduction-static-site-generators"
        >static website generator</a
      >
      using Python and the
      <a href="http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/templates/"
        >Django template system</a
      >. Cactus also makes it easy to develop locally and deploy your site to S3
      directly. It works great for company, portfolio, personal, support
      websites and blogs.

      Cactus is based on the idea that most dynamicness on websites these days
      can be done using Javascript while the actual site can stay static. Static
      websites are easy to host and typically very fast.
    </p>
    <p>
      I developed Cactus because I wanted a standard, easy system that designers
      at Sofa could use to build and deploy fast websites. So typical users
      would be designers that are tech-savvy, want to use templates, but donâ€™t
      like to mess with setting up django or S3.

    <p>
      Since then it has evolved quite a bit with a plugin system that supports
      blogging, spriting, versioning and is extensible.
