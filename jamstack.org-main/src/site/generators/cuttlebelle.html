    <h2 id="what-is-cuttlebelle">What is Cuttlebelle?</h2>
    <p>
      Cuttlebelle is a static site generator that uses react for layouts, let’s
      you use one layout per page-partial and cleanly separates content from
      code.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can extend Cuttlebelle with react components that can make use of the
      power of the npm ecosystem.
    </p>
    <h2 id="modularize-each-page-into-partials">
      Modularize each page into partials
    </h2>
    <p>
      Each section of your page becomes a markdown file with front-matter. The
      content can be written in <a href="http://yaml.org/">YAML</a> or
      [markdown](https://github.com/chjj/marked. A layout is nominated per
      partial.
    </p>
    <h2 id="write-your-layout-in-react">Write your layout in react</h2>
    <p>
      The layout is written in
      <a href="https://facebook.github.io/jsx/">JSX</a> as a react component.
      Each variable in your front-matter becomes a prop of the layout.
    </p>
    <h2 id="multiple-layouts">Multiple layouts</h2>
    <p>
      Each page is divided into components that have their own layouts. Think of
      it like little <a href="https://www.lego.com/">Lego™ blocks</a> that make
      up your site.
    </p>
    <p>
      With that you can build completely new page layouts by assembling them
      from your smaller partials without having to touch code.
    </p>
    <h2 id="clean-separation">Clean separation</h2>
    <p>
      Keeping your content free of any code empowers more users to change the
      content of your site. And because we chunk it all up into partials,
      content authors are able to build completely new layouts all by them-self
      without ever touching more complex code.
    </p>
    <p>
      Separation also means searching through your content is easier and you can
      reuse layout as well as content blocks easily.
    </p>
    <h2 id="easy-templating">Easy templating</h2>
    <p>
      Cuttlebelle uses <a href="https://facebook.github.io/jsx/">JSX</a> as the
      templating language. This makes it very convenient to build simple layouts
      all the way to super complex ones that fetch data from online APIs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now you can start testing your layouts with
      <a href="https://facebook.github.io/jest/">Jest</a> or any other react
      tester.
    </p>
    <h2 id="no-lock-in">No lock-in</h2>
    <p>
      With Cuttlebelle you’re not locked into any CMS and are able to move to
      another solution as your websites scales.
    </p>
    <p>
      All your content is in easy digestible markdown files and can be exported
      to javascript objects.
