    <p>
      OrisonJS is a static site generator built on top of lit-html. It provides
      a server for easy development, a preview server for previewing the built
      site, and a build command for building a static site from your source. The
      build command can be carefully configured to only rebuild the portions of
      the site that you want. This makes it indefinitely scalable for websites
      with a large number of pages or with a large number of rebuilds from
      content updates. Layouts are contextually applied to pages based upon
      their location in the site hierarchy and partials allow reuse of common
      elements.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pages files, layouts, and partials are all JavaScript files that export an
      async function. This function is provided contextual data about it’s
      location in the site hierarchy, it’s path, and accessor methods for
      crawling up the site heirachy with <code>parent</code> methods or crawling
      down the site hierarchy with <code>child</code> methods. This enables rich
      contextual functionality. These JavaScript files can also call third party
      services to pull in dynamic content, and can be hooked up to web hooks for
      rebuilding the site as content changes. Pages can also be declared as a
      list, so a single page file produces a list of pages on your site, useful
      for generating a list of blog posts or product pages by connecting to a
      CMS, for example.
    </p>
    <p>
      All pages also produce fragments. These are html files with the same
      content as the full page but without the layout applied. This makes
      implementing single page application style redirects easy to implement,
      and the template projects do just this.
    </p>
    <p>
      Projects can be initialized for use with Netlify, Firebase, or GitHub
      Pages, and can be easily configured for any hosting service.
