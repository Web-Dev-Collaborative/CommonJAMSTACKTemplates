      Dapper is a simple, flexible, and pragmatic static site generator written
      in Perl. Dapper takes your content (Markdown), combines with templates
      (based on the TT3 mini-language), and creates a set of static files that
      you can upload to your favorite webhost.
    </p>
    <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
    <p>
      <a href="http://search.cpan.org/~mdb/App-Dapper/"
        >Distributed as a Perl module</a
      >, Dapper comes with a command-line application called
      <code>dapper</code> which you can use to create static websites.
    </p>
    <pre><code>$ cpanm App::Dapper
$ dapper init
$ dapper serve # Serve site at http://localhost:8000</code></pre>
    <h3 id="goals">Goals</h3>
    <p>Dapper has three goals:</p>
    <ol type="1">
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Simple</strong>. Learning Dapper is easy – it gets out of the
          way so you can write content, develop layouts, and deploy to
          production the way you want.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Flexible</strong>. Content is written in
          <a href="http://search.cpan.org/~bobtfish/Text-MultiMarkdown/"
            >Markdown</a
          >, and templates are written using the TT3 mini-language from
          <a href="http://search.cpan.org/~abw/Template-Toolkit/"
            >Template::Alloy</a
          >
          for maximum flexibility.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Pragmatic</strong>. The easy things are easy and the hard
          things are possible. Dapper was created to solve problems in a
          straight-forward and intuitive way.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h3 id="rationale">Rationale</h3>
    <p>Why static? Decent question. Here are some reasons:</p>
    <ol type="1">
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Fast</strong>. Static pages are fast to load and easy to
          cache. Content management systems, on the other hand, may contact the
          database at least one time per page request, process the results,
          merge with a templating system, and serve the result to the user’s web
          browser.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Cheap</strong>. Having a static website means that options for
          hosting those static files also just got a lot more simple. No
          database is needed and no real processing power for scripting is
          needed. For example, with a static website, it becomes possible to
          host the site on <a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a>,
          <a href="https://www.bitballoon.com/">BitBalloon</a>, or
          <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/s3/">Amazon S3</a> for free or for very
          modest fees.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Secure</strong>. It’s much more secure to host a static
          website than a dynamic one. Content management systems that use
          scripting languages such as Perl, Python, or Ruby, all are more
          susceptible to being hacked than a static website is. Simply stated,
          why use a dynamic content- management system if a static setup will
          do?
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Portable</strong>. With a static website, it’s way easier to
          move the site to a new host in the future. All web hosts now and in
          the future support serving up a static website – think of it as the
          lowest common denominator – and so there’s no need to pick a premium
          host with premium services.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h3 id="background">Background</h3>
    <p>
      Dapper was first written in 2002 to facilitate the creation of a series of
      static websites that each had their own look and feel, but shared content.
      Since then, Dapper has been used to create websites for speakers, artists,
      authors, illusionists, web designers, piano tuners, photographers,
      entertainment agencies, and API documentation for industrial sensing
      equipment. In addition, it is the tool that powers
      <a href="http://vanilladraft.com/">Vanilla Draft</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 2014, Dapper was submitted as a Perl module (App::Dapper) to
      <a href="http://cpan.org/">CPAN</a> under the MIT license for anyone to
      use for any purpose.
