<p>Statik aims to be a simple, generic, static web site generator for developers. It has been born out of a need for something more generic than most other static web site generators, which mostly cater for building blogs. It allows for a generic data model, and provides a SQLite interface for you to be able to perform relatively complex queries from your views. Its templating engine is based on the popular Jinja2, so if you come from a Django background, it is very easy to pick up. Alternatively, you could opt for Mustache templating.</p>
<p>Ultimately, it generates a set of flat HTML files that should be able to be served directly by your web server.</p>
