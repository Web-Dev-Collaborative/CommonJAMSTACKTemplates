      Orchid is a general-purpose static site generator with a focus on
      extensibility, and aimed at developers looking to improve their technical
      documentation. Orchid was born out of a desire for better-looking Javadocs
      and frustration with how difficult is it to manage large Jekyll sites and
      keep it up-to-date with your code.
    </p>
    <p>
      Orchid supports a variety of plugins, including a wiki, static pages,
      blogs, and much more. It aims to have high compatibility with many of the
      existing static site generators, such as Jekyll, Gitbook, and Hugo, so
      that migration to Orchid is painless. And if you canâ€™t find a plugin to do
      what you need, Orchid provides an intuitive way to add your own private
      plugins and a rich API so you can make your site as beautiful and unique
      as an Orchid.
