<p>Most. Zen. Static. Website. Generator. Ever.</p>
<h2 id="why-another-one-cmon-you-must-be-kidding">Why another one? C’mon, you must be kidding…</h2>
<p>I just wanted to set up a very simple website (just a few pages) with Jekyll and it didn’t feel right. I didn’t want a blog.</p>
<p>I checked other projects but they were incomplete, cumbersome or solved the wrong problem (blogs, blogs everywhere). I wanted a zen-like experience. Just a layout and some Markdown files as pages with unobstrusive structure and configuration.</p>
<p>Yes, it is another NIH but… I think Zas is a different kind of beast. I admit that I probably overlooked some projects.</p>
<h3 id="where-is-the-difference">Where is the difference?</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li>Gophers. Yes, there is <a href="http://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a> (kudos!) but… Who wants to learn another directory layout? There is also <a href="https://github.com/mkaz/hastie">Hastie</a> too. If you want a blog.</li>
<li>Markdown only. And HTML, if you want.</li>
<li>Just a loop. Zas just loops over all .md and .html files in current directory (and subdirectories), ignoring all any other file (including dot-files).</li>
<li>Your imagination as limit. Zas has a simple extension mechanism based in subcommands. Do you really need to handle a blog with Zas? Install/create a new extension and do it!</li>
<li>Unobstrutive structure, no ‘_’ files. More in <a href="#usage">Usage</a> section.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>
<p>Install:</p>
<pre><code>$ go get github.com/imdario/zas</code></pre>
<p>Go to your site’s directory and do:</p>
<pre><code>$ zas init</code></pre>
<p>A .zas directory will be created with sane defaults. Put your layout in .zas/layout.html and you are ready.</p>
<pre><code>$ zas</code></pre>
<p>Yes. Enough. Your delightful site is on .zas/deploy. Enjoy.</p>
<p>What is happening here? Well, “generate” subcommand is called by default. This subcommand accepts the following flags:</p>
<ul>
<li>-verbose: print ALL the things!</li>
<li>-full: generates all the input files. By default, zas has an incremental mode which keeps source and deploy directories in sync.</li>
</ul>
