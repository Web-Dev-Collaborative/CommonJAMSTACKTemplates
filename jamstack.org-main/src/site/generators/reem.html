      Reem is different from other static site generators in the amount of
      control developers are allowed during the build phase. The source
      directory is expanded into a tree data structure that can be traversed and
      manipulated in ideally any way desired and then is written to the output
      directory. Plugins are added to Reem like middleware in Express and Reem
      seperates files into four middleware stacks, one each for posts, pages,
      files, and lists (folders). Reem really is quite feature rich and should
      not be summed up in a paragraph.
