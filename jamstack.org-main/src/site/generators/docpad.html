      Hi! I’m DocPad, I streamline the web development process and help close
      the gap between experts and beginners. I’ve been used in production by big
      and small companies for over a year and a half now to create
      <a href="http://docpad.org/docs/showcase"
        >plenty of amazing and powerful web sites and applications</a
      >
      quicker than ever before. What makes me different is instead of being a
      box to cram yourself into and hold you back, I’m a freeway to what you
      want to accomplish, just getting out of your way and allowing you to
      create stuff quicker than ever before without limits. Leave the redundant
      stuff up to me, so you can focus on the awesome stuff.
    </p>

      to get started with a
      <a href="http://docpad.org/docs/skeletons"

    <ul>
      <li>
        Completely file based meaning there is no pesky databases that need to
        be installed, and for version control you get to use systems like Git
        and SVN which you’re already use to (You can still hook in remote data
        sources if you want, DocPad doesn’t impose any limits on you, ever)
      </li>
      <li>
        Choose from plenty of community maintained
        <a href="http://docpad.org/docs/skeletons">pre-made websites</a> to use
        for your next project instead of starting from scratch everytime
      </li>
      <li>
        Write your documents in any language, markup, templating engine, or
        pre-processor you wish (we’re truly agnostic thanks to your plugin
        system). You can even mix and match them when needed by combining their
        extensions in a rails like fashion
        (e.g. <code>coffee-with-some-eco.js.coffee.eco</code>)
      </li>
      <li>
        Changes to your website are automatically recompiled through our built
        in watch system
      </li>
      <li>
        Add meta data to the top of your files to be used by templating engines
        to display non-standard information such as titles and descriptions for
        your documents
      </li>
      <li>
        Display custom listings of content with our powerful
        <a href="https://github.com/bevry/query-engine/">Query Engine</a>
        available to your templating engines
      </li>
      <li>
        Abstract out generic headers and footers into layouts using our nested
        layout system
      </li>
      <li>
        For simple static websites easily deploy your generated website to any
        web server like apache or github pages. For dynamic projects deploy them
        to servers like <a href="http://www.heroku.com/">heroku</a> or
        <a href="http://nodejitsu.com/">nodejitsu</a> to take advantage of
        custom routing with <a href="http://expressjs.com/">express.js</a>.
        <a href="http://docpad.org/docs/deploy">Deploy guide here</a>
      </li>
      <li>
        Built-in server to save you from having to startup your own, for dynamic
        deployments this even supports things like clean urls, custom routes and
        server-side logic
      </li>
      <li>
        Robust architecture and powerful plugin system means that you are never
        boxed in unlike traditional CMS systems, instead you can always
        <a href="http://docpad.org/docs/extend">extend DocPad</a> to do whatever
        you need it to do, and you can even write to bundle common custom
        functionality and distribute them through the amazing node package
        manager <a href="http://npmjs.org/">npm</a>
      </li>
      <li>
        Built in support for dynamic documents (e.g. search pages, signup forms,
        etc.), so you can code pages that change on each request by just adding
        <code>dynamic: true</code> to your document’s meta data (exposes the
        <a href="http://expressjs.com/">express.js</a> <code>req</code> and
        <code>res</code> objects to your templating engine)
      </li>
      <li>
        You can use it standalone, or even easily include it within your
        existing systems with our <a href="http://docpad.org/docs/api">API</a>
