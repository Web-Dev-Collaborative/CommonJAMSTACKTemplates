      Modern web tech without the headache
    </h2>
    <p>
      Enjoy the power of the latest web technologies – React.js, Webpack, modern
      JavaScript and CSS and more — all setup and waiting for you to start
      building.
    </p>
    <h2 id="bring-your-own-data">Bring your own data</h2>
    <p>
      Gatsby’s rich data plugin ecosystem lets you build sites with the data you
      want — from one or many sources: Pull data from headless CMSs, SaaS
      services, APIs, databases, your file system &amp; more directly into your
      pages using GraphQL.
    </p>
    <h2 id="scale-to-the-entire-internet">Scale to the entire internet</h2>
    <p>
      Gatsby.js is Internet Scale. Forget complicated deploys with databases and
      servers and their expensive, time-consuming setup costs, maintenance, and
      scaling fears. Gatsby.js builds your site as “static” files which can be
      deployed easily on dozens of services.
    </p>
    <h2 id="future-proof-your-website">Future-proof your website</h2>
    <p>
      Don’t build a website with last decade’s tech. The future of the web is
      mobile, JavaScript and APIs—the Jamstack. Every website is a web app and
      every web app is a website. Gatsby.js is the universal JavaScript
      framework you’ve been waiting for.
    </p>
    <h2 id="static-progressive-web-apps">Static Progressive Web Apps</h2>
    <p>
      Gatsby.js is a static PWA (Progressive Web App) generator. You get code
      and data splitting out-of-the-box. Gatsby loads only the critical HTML,
      CSS, data, and JavaScript so your site loads as fast as possible. Once
      loaded, Gatsby prefetches resources for other pages so clicking around the
      site feels incredibly fast.
    </p>
    <h2 id="speed-past-the-competition">Speed past the competition</h2>
    <p>
      Gatsby.js builds the fastest possible website. Instead of waiting to
      generate pages when requested, pre-build pages and lift them into a global
      cloud of servers — ready to be delivered instantly to your users wherever
      they are.
