        Modern static website generator for creating dynamic websites using
        React components.

      Write your content in
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown">Markdown</a> files.
      Implement your design with JavaScript files, using
      <a href="http://facebook.github.io/react/">React</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>No template language to learn. Just JavaScript</strong> (and JSX
      if you like it).
    </p>
    <p>
      You can just grab some packages on the
      <a href="http://npmjs.org/">NPM ecosystem</a> to help you build your
      website, blog or even a small app.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Phenomic</em> will help you generate and deploy a website in a
      heartbeat.

      React is used to generate pages for both client and server; it’s called
      <del>Isomorphic</del>
      <a href="https://medium.com/@mjackson/universal-javascript-4761051b7ae9"
        >Universal rendering</a
      >.
    </p>
    <p>
      A pre-rendered, <em>static</em> version of your website is generated
      first; then when a user browses your website,
      <strong
        >they can get the same UX as an app by grabbing the minimal amount of
        data for each new page</strong
      >
      (a single file that only contains your page data).

      Creating a website based on Phenomic only takes a minute. Why not give it
      a try?

      During development, enjoy the benefit of hot loading with visual errors in
      your layout! That means you won’t have to refresh your page during
      development when you edit your website. You will also see compilation
      &amp; runtime errors.

      <em>Phenomic</em> is easily customizable; choose your own Markdown engine
      (with your own plugins), your own CSS preprocessor etc, thanks to the
      flexibility of Webpack and its loaders.
