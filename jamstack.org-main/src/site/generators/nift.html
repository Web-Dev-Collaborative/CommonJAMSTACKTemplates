      Nift, short for nifty site manager, is a cross-platform open source
      git-like and LaTeX-like site manager. You should be able to create any
      site you want (both static and non-static/dynamic) using Nift, though will
      need some kind of web server such as Apache, NGinx, a LAMP stack, etc. to
      host non-static/dynamic sites, whereas static sites can easily be hosted
      with platforms like BitBucket, GitHub, GitLab and Netlify.

      The intent for creating Nift (aka nsm) in the first place was to make a
      command-line site manager that was as git-like and LaTeX-like as possible,
      the creator/developer of Nift has achieved what was desired and hopes
      others may find it just as useful for their own wants and/or needs.
