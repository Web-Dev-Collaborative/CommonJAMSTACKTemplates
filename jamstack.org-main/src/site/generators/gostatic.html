      Gostatic is a static site generator. What differs it from most of other
      tools is that it’s written in Go and tracks changes, which means it should
      work reasonably <a href="#speed">fast</a>.
    </p>
    <p>Features include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        No run-time dependencies, just a single binary - download it and run
      </li>
      <li>Dependency tracking and re-rendering only changed pages</li>
      <li>Markdown support</li>
      <li>Flexible <a href="#processors">filter system</a></li>
      <li>Simple <a href="#configuration">config syntax</a></li>
      <li>HTTP server and watcher (instant rendering on changes)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="quick-start">Quick Start</h3>
    <p>
      Run <code>gostatic -i my-site</code> to generate basic site in directory
      <code>name</code>. It will have a basic <code>config</code> file, which
      you should edit to put relevant variables at the top - it also contains
      description of how files in your <code>src</code> directory are treated.
    </p>
    <p>
      <code>src</code> directory obviously contains sources of your site (name
      of this directory can be changed in <code>config</code>). You can follow
      general idea of this directory to create new blog posts or new pages. All
      files, which are not mentioned in <code>config</code>, are just copied
      over. Run <code>gostatic -fv config</code> to see how your
      <code>src</code> is processed.
    </p>
    <p>
      <code>site.html</code> is a file that defines templates your are able to
      use for your pages. You can see those templates mentioned in
      <code>config</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      And, finally, there is a <code>Makefile</code>, just for convenience. Run
      <code>make</code> to build your site once or <code>make w</code> to run
      watcher and server, to see your site changes in real time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Also, you could look at
      <a href="https://github.com/piranha/solovyov.net">my site</a> for an
      example of advanced usage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Good luck! And remember, your contributions either to gostatic or to
      documentation (even if it’s just this <code>README.md</code>) are always
      very welcome!
