      Grow’s mission is to bring joy to building and launching microsites
    </h3>
    <p>
      We want Grow to be the canonical way for teams and individuals to build,
      launch, and maintain high-quality, content-rich web sites. It’s
      architected to work for humans, to allow people pair it with their own
      development tools, to run locally and in the cloud, and to bring
      simplicity to web site management.
    </p>
    <p>
      Grow (the app) and the stuff you make with it (your sites) are portable.
      You can run Grow anywhere, and you can take your content anywhere because
      your content is stored as flat files. There will never be lock-in with
      Grow.
    </p>
    <h3 id="configuration-not-code.">Configuration, not code.</h3>
    <p>
      Control your site’s URLs, content hierarchy, structure and behavior all
      with configuration, not with code. You won’t have to program your site’s
      serving logic again and again, so website production stays rapid and
      nimble. Modifications to to your architecture are always just a config
      change away.
    </p>

    </h3>
    <p>
      Flexible localization is easy and comes included. You can configure
      localized URL formats, easily specify what content is translated and what
      isn’t, localize your content, and integrate with translation providers to
      translate your projects.
    </p>
    <h3 id="develop-everywhere-deploy-anywhere.">
      Develop everywhere, deploy anywhere.
    </h3>
    <p>
      Grow sites are entirely file-based, backed by Git with no database to
      maintain. Development can happen locally or in the cloud. You can deploy
      to a variety of destinations – including exporting as static files for
      integration with your custom server.
    </p>
    <h3 id="no-installation-or-maintenance.">
      No installation or maintenance.
    </h3>
    <p>
      Focus on what matters (your web sites!) when using Grow. Your projects are
      stored and managed entirely separate from the app, so you’ll never have to
      maintain a deployed installation or deal with upgrades. Grow tests and
      verifies your sites upon each build.
