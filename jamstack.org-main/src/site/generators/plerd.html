      Plerd is a minimalist blogging platform for people who love writing with
      <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a> using
      their favorite text editors, and who wish to host their own blogs as
      simple, attractive, static websites wholly under their own control.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a href="https://github.com/jmacdotorg/plerd"
        >Plerd is free and open-source software</a
      >, regularly used and actively maintained by its creator. All bloggers
      everywhere may use Plerd themselves at no cost, however they see fit.
    </p>
    <h2 id="aliveexample">A live example</h2>
    <p>
      Plerd’s creator, Jason McIntosh, publishes
      <a href="http://fogknife.com">his blog</a> entirely with Plerd. It’s just
      a static website. Every time Jason adds or edits a post, Plerd’s daemon
      processes modify the site’s files as needed.
    </p>
    <h2 id="features">Features</h2>
    <p>
      Plerd’s strength comes from its minimalism. It gives you the ability to
      turn a folder of Markdown files on your computer into a beautiful,
      easy-to-edit website, and leaves the rest up to you.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Support for exactly one user per blog. No authentication to worry about,
        nor multi-user complexities to set up.
      </li>
      <li>
        Outputs completely static websites. No server-side scripting to tangle
        with.
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          No user interface at all, other than your favorite text editor and
          your own computer’s file system.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Create posts by adding Markdown files into a designated directory.
          </li>
          <li>
            Edit posts by editing the files within that directory using any text
            editor you wish. Plerd will update your blog every time you save
            changes to your file.
          </li>
          <li>Delete posts by moving files outside of that directory.</li>
          <li>
            <strong>Works great with Dropbox!</strong> If you keep your
            blog-source directory in Dropbox, then you can edit posts as local
            files on your laptop.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Requires no extra database setup. Your one directory of
        directly-editable Markdown files represents the entirety of your blog’s
        data source.
      </li>
      <li>
        Minimal metadata: no categories, no tags. Just your posts, their titles,
        and their timestamps.
      </li>
      <li>
        Gives your blog an RSS feed and an archives page, both always kept up to
        date.
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Your blog’s static HTML is generated by completely customizable
          <a href="http://template-toolkit.org">Template Toolkit</a> files.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The default templates are based on
            <a href="http://getbootstrap.com">Bootstrap</a>, capable of
            generating a beautiful, modern, responsive website out of the box.
          </li>
          <li>
            The default templates also give your blog a search engine, via
            <a href="http://duckduckgo.com">DuckDuckGo</a>.
          </li>
          <li>
            You can add external features like Disqus comments, Google
            Analytics, and Twitter widgets simply by pasting them into your
            templates.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="howplerdworks">How Plerd works</h2>
    <p>
      Plerd includes a daemon-style program called “plerdwatcher” which monitors
      a specific directory for changes. Every time it sees a change, it treats
      all the Markdown files inside at directory as blog posts, applying them to
      a set of templates. Within moments, it has generated a complete blog
      website, including an updated RSS feed.
    </p>
    <p>That’s it.</p>
    <h2 id="installationanddocumentation">Installation and documentation</h2>
    <p>
      Installing Plerd involves downloading the software, running a single
      command-line invocation to get all its prerequisites into place, and then
      configuring it to taste.
    </p>
    <p>
      For now, you may find all Plerd documentation on
      <a href="https://github.com/jmacdotorg/plerd#readme"
        >the project’s GitHub page</a
      >. Installation assumes access to a Unix command line.
    </p>
