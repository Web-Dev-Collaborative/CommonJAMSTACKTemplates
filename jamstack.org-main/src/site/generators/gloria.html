      available in npm.

      This project aims to be a substitute for jekyll, to help you create static
      websites without depending on ruby.

      Gloria works as easy as possible, with extensions to allow you to use your
      favorite template engine, CSS preprocessor, and anything else.

      Our goal is to have an open source project that is beginner friendly, if
      you want to contribute but have little experience as a developer or in
      open source, we can pair with you and help you. Is a great excuse to work
      in a non-trivial Node codebase and get started on open source.
