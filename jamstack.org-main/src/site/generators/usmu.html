      Usmu is a small, simple but extensible static site generator. It takes
      your input files in Markdown and Slim and translates them to HTML files
      suitable for hosting virtually anywhere with built-in support for S3 or
      Github Pages.

      Usmu Core is designed to be small and do the bare minimum possible - turn
      your files into HTML. Everything else is provided by plugins that are
      typically small and incredibly easy to implement. Various deployment
      options are available as well as other plugins that add other features to
      your website like automatically generated sitemaps. Plugins are easy to
      install - just install the gem.
    </p>
    <h3 id="templates">Templates</h3>
    <p>
      Usmu makes use of the Tilt templating API to provide as many options as
      possible as easily as possible. All you need to do to use a different
      language is install the relevant gem and then it is immediately available.
      Want to use Sass or LESS to write your CSS? Coffeescript? No problem. Tilt
      are open to community-managed interfaces for supporting template languages
      they donâ€™t yet officially support so nothing is impossible.
