    <p>
      Charge is an opinionated, zero-config static site generator written in
      JavaScript. It supports a wide variety of common uses and it does it
      without needing to be configured or customized. It’s fast, it’s simple,
      and it works the way you probably expect it to. That’s it.

      How is Charge different from GatsbyJS?
    </h2>
    <p>
      <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org">Gatsby</a> is really cool, but it’s
      very different than Charge, with two particularly large differences.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gatsby is configuration over convention. It can be used to build complex
      web applications, but because of that it’s extremely difficult to
      understand how to use it. You’ll need to know how to use Webpack, which
      personally gives me nightmares. It’s extremely likely that you’ll need to
      spend time learning other tools and then configuring and tweaking Gatsby
      before you can use it for your site. Charge is convention over
      configuration. In fact, it has no configuration, it “just works”.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gatsby renders pages client-side. That means it serves React and some
      related libraries to the browser along with your components in order to
      render the pages. Routing also happens client-side. Gatsby
      <em>can</em> render the initial page load server-side, but there’s no way
      to <em>not</em> serve hundreds of kilobytes of JavaScript to the browser.
      Charge uses React to render everything server-side. It generates a truly
      static site.
    </p>
    <p>
      More practically, Gatsby is great if you’re building a large, complex
      website and want lots of control over how you build it. Charge is probably
      better if you’re building a small website and don’t want to waste time
      fiddling with configurations and cobbling different tools together.
