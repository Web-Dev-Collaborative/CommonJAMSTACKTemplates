      This project is heavily inspired by Hugo and tries to be somewhat
      compatible with the same content structure and support parsing of TOML,
      YAML and JSON front matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      The content file layer is converted to C# lists and objects and then used
      in a regular ASP.NET Core MVC project which is also where you can work
      live on both content preview and templating. This means you now can use
      your existing ASP.NET MVC and C# skills creating static site templates!
    </p>
    <p>
      In this setup the generation process work using the WebApplicationFactory
      from the Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Testing package so it doesnâ€™t have to
      fall back to a console application or custom web servers for crunching the
      files and templates which is the norm for static site generation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Easy to deploy to Netlify and repo also has examples for various Docker
      scenarios.
    </p>
    <p>
      It can also run as a regular .NET Core MVC application with real-time
      rendering.
