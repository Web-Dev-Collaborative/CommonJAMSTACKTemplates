      Jekyll is a simple, blog-aware, static site generator perfect for
      personal, project, or organization sites. Think of it like a file-based
      CMS, without all the complexity. Jekyll takes your content, renders
      Markdown and Liquid templates, and spits out a complete, static website
      ready to be served by Apache, Nginx or another web server. Jekyll is the
      engine behind <a href="https://pages.github.com">GitHub Pages</a>, which
      you can use to host sites right from your GitHub repositories.

      Jekyll does what you tell it to do — no more, no less. It doesn’t try to
      outsmart users by making bold assumptions, nor does it burden them with
      needless complexity and configuration. Put simply, Jekyll gets out of your
      way and allows you to concentrate on what truly matters: your content.
