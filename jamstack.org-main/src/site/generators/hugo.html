      Hugo is a static site generator written in Go. It is optimized for speed,
      easy use and configurability. Hugo takes a directory with content and
      templates and renders them into a full html website.
    </p>
    <p>Hugo makes use of Markdown files with front matter for meta data.</p>
    <p>
      A typical website of moderate size can be rendered in a fraction of a
      second. A good rule of thumb is that Hugo takes around 1 millisecond for
      each piece of content.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is written to work well with any kind of website including blogs,
      tumbles and docs.
