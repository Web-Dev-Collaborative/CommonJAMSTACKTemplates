    <p>
      By giving authors the full expressive power of Scheme, they are able to
      control every aspect of the site generation process. Haunt provides a
      simple, functional build system that can be easily extended for this
      purpose.

    <p>
      Haunt has no opinion about what markup language authors should use to
      write posts, though it comes with support for the popular Markdown format.
      Likewise, Haunt has no opinion about how authors structure their sites.
      Though it comes with support for building simple blogs or Atom feeds,
      authors should feel empowered to tweak, replace, or create builders to do
      things that arenâ€™t provided out-of-the-box.
