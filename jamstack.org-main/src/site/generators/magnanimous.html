    <p>
      Magnanimous is a simple, fast static website generator made for
      programmers.
    </p>
    <p>
      It has its own tiny template language to make it as easy as possible to
      include files or part of files into other files, re-use variables, use for
      loops over literals or collections (e.g.Â files in a directory), compose
      components and many other things.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is written in Go, so it is distributed as a single binary in all
      platforms, runs extremely fast and integrates very well with other Unixy
      tools.
