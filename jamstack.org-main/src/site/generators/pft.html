      PFT It is yet another <em>Static</em>, <em>Unicode-ready</em>,
      <em>Hacker-friendly</em>, <em>Free-as-in-freedom</em>,
      <em>Privacy-preserving</em> website generator written in Perl.
    </p>
    <p>
      <code>PFT</code> stands for <em>Plain F. Text</em>, where the meaning of
      <em>F.</em> is up to personal interpretation. Like <em>Fancy</em> or
      <em>Fantastic</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      I started it from scratch because as I was not entirely satisfied with the
      similar products I tried, but also because I wanted to learn another
      language (Perl) with a side project. I got initially inspired by
      <a href="https://www.staticgen.com/dapper">Dapper</a>, which is similar in
      the spirit, but maybe a bit <em>too raw</em>, even for my needs.
    </p>
    <h2 id="unicode-ready">Unicode-ready</h2>
    <p>
      While writing PFT I also learned how how to handle Unicode. As a result,
      PFT can seamlessly handle your UTF-8 text, with â˜º emoticons and similar
      ðŸ’©.
    </p>
    <h2 id="hacker-friendly">Hacker Friendly</h2>
    <p>
      PFT is designed to be Hacker Friendly: itâ€™s a command-line application
      which handles your websiteâ€™s boilerplate, hides you nothing, but stays out
      of the way.
    </p>
    <p>It is designed as a toolkit, and comes with a number of commands:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          <code>pft init</code>: Initialize a PFT site in the current directory;
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <code>pft edit</code>: Create a content text (e.g.Â page or blog
          entry);
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><code>pft make</code>: Build the website;</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><code>pft pub</code>: Publish the website;</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><code>pft clean</code>: Clear built tree;</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><code>pft grab</code>: Grab a file as attachment or picture;</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><code>pft ls</code>: List content and properties;</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><code>pft show</code>: Show the compiled site in a web browser;</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The manual of each sub-command is available in form of Unix Manual page,
      and by invoking it with the <code>--help</code> flag.
    </p>
    <p>
      Content pages are simple locale-encoded
      <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a>
      text-files wrapped with a <a href="http://yaml.org/">YAML</a> header.
      Everything is transformed into HTML thanks to the
      <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Template::Alloy">Template::Alloy</a>
      engine.
    </p>
    <h2 id="free-as-in-freedom">Free as in Freedom</h2>
    <p>
      PFT is
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software_movement"
        >Free as in Freedom</a
      >
      and licensed as
      <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html">GNU GPL v3</a>.
      Contributions and suggestions are welcome.
    </p>
    <p>
      PFT is also Free as in Free Beer. Which means you can
      <em>offer me a beer</em> if you feel like doing it.
    </p>
    <h2 id="privacy-preserving">Privacy preserving:</h2>
    <p>
      By default, PFT comes with some simple templates, which do not rely on
      client-side scripts, cookies or trackers. This means a PFT site respects
      your privacy by default.
    </p>
    <p>
      (Of course nothing prevents you from modifying it and provide something
      more fancy, or even serve it with cookies. As you would do for tea,
      really.)
    </p>
    <h1 id="running-pft">Running PFT</h1>
    <p>
      PFT is released as <em>CPAN</em> distribution named
      <a href="https://metacpan.org/release/App-PFT">App::PFT</a>. If CPAN is
      installed on your system you can simply install PFT by running the
      following command:
    </p>
    <pre><code>cpan App::PFT</code></pre>
    <h2 id="requirements">Requirements</h2>
    <p>
      The output of PFT is a directory containing a set of inter-connected HTML
      pages. The pages are linked by relative links, so the whole output site is
      relocatable. It can optionally be loaded online and served through any web
      server.
    </p>
    <p>
      Currently only <a href="https://rsync.samba.org/">RSync</a> over
      <a href="http://www.openssh.com/">SSH</a> is supported for uploading
      content on websites, RSync must be therefore installed on your source
      system, and your hosting provider should support
      <a href="http://www.openssh.com/">SSH</a>.
    </p>
    <h1 id="hacking">Hacking</h1>
    <p>PFT is currently composed by:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          A Perl library named
          <a href="https://github.com/dacav/pft">PFT</a> which abstracts the
          filesystem access
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          A toolkit of Perl scripts named
          <a href="https://github.com/dacav/app-pft">App::PFT</a> which provides
          a command-line interface to the <em>PFT</em> structure.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
