      Built upon proven open source technology as a “reimagined” fork of Jekyll,
      Bridgetown is a fast, scalable, modular, and thoroughly forward-looking
      framework for building websites and frontend applications.
    </p>
    <h2 id="write-content">Write Content</h2>
    <p>
      Content in Bridgetown is simply text files in your repository. Write
      flexible Markdown and use sophisticated Liquid tags to enhance your
      presentation and functionality. Using a headless CMS or third-party APIs?
      That works too!
    </p>
    <h2 id="design-with-components">Design with Components</h2>
    <p>
      Encapsulate common building-blocks of your design which can be reused
      across multiple pages and contexts or displayed in an always up-to-date
      style guide.
    </p>
    <h2 id="customize-with-plugins">Customize with Plugins</h2>
    <p>
      Write your own plugins in the delightful Ruby programming language to
      facilitate totally custom projects, or simply add community gems to
      supercharge your site build.
    </p>
    <h2 id="add-a-modern-frontend">Add a Modern Frontend</h2>
    <p>
      Bridgetown comes with support for Webpack out-of-the-box, which means you
      can add Javascript frameworks like React, Vue, Stimulus as well as CSS
      frameworks like Bulma or Tailwind to get a leg up fast.
    </p>
    <h2 id="future-roadmap">Future Roadmap</h2>
    <p>
      Bridgetown has an extenstive roadmap and strives to maintain a predictable
      release schedule. A key goal of the project is to be a reliable partner
      for commercial solution providers by ensuring their frontline work with
      clients goes well and feedback flows positively into the Bridgetown
      feature set.
