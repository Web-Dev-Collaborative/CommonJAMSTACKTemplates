    <p>
      Sphinx is a tool that makes it easy to create intelligent and beautiful
      documentation, written by Georg Brandl and licensed under the BSD license.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was originally created for the new Python documentation, and it has
      excellent facilities for the documentation of Python projects, but C/C++
      is already supported as well, and it is planned to add special support for
      other languages as well. Of course, this site is also created from
      reStructuredText sources using Sphinx! The following features should be
      highlighted:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Output formats</strong>: HTML (including Windows HTML Help),
        LaTeX (for printable PDF versions), ePub, Texinfo, manual pages, plain
        text
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Extensive cross-references</strong>: semantic markup and
        automatic links for functions, classes, citations, glossary terms and
        similar pieces of information
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Hierarchical structure</strong>: easy definition of a document
        tree, with automatic links to siblings, parents and children
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Automatic indices</strong>: general index as well as a
        language-specific module indices
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Code handling</strong>: automatic highlighting using the
        Pygments highlighter
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Extensions</strong>: automatic testing of code snippets,
        inclusion of docstrings from Python modules (API docs), and more
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Contributed extensions</strong>: more than 50 extensions
        contributed by users in a second repository; most of them installable
        from PyPI
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Sphinx uses reStructuredText as its markup language, and many of its
      strengths come from the power and straightforwardness of reStructuredText
      and its parsing and translating suite, the Docutils.
