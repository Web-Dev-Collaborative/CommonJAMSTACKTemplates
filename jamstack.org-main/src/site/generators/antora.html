    <p>
      Antora is a modular, multi-repository site generator designed for
      producing documentation sites from content composed in AsciiDoc and
      converted to HTML using Asciidoctor and Handlebars.
    </p>
    <p>
      Antora provides both a toolchain and workflow to help documentation and
      engineering teams create, manage, collaborate on, remix, and publish
      documentation sites aggregated from multi-branch git repositories without
      needing expertise in web technologies, build automation, or system
      administration.
    </p>
    <h3 id="who-its-for">Who it’s for</h3>
    <p>Tech writers, first and foremost.</p>
    <p>
      If you’re already using Asciidoctor, and you need help managing a large
      set of documentation written in AsciiDoc, Antora was designed for you. If
      you haven’t yet tried Asciidoctor (or AsciiDoc), Antora is a great way to
      get started because it provides everything you need to start writing and
      publishing documentation today.
    </p>
    <h3 id="what-it-includes">What it includes</h3>
    <p>
      Antora includes a command line interface (CLI) (command: antora), a
      preassembled site generator pipeline, and a default UI so you can get
      started quickly publishing documentation sites with Antora.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since Antora is both modular and extensible, there are plenty of
      opportunities to explore to take it further once you have your first site
      up and running.
    </p>
    <h3 id="availability">Availability</h3>
    <p>
      Antora is available as a suite of npm packages and a Docker image. Antora
      runs on any platform that supports Node, which includes Linux, macOS, and
      Windows.
