    <p>
      Bashblog-ng is based on bashblog. The reasons for forking an already great
      project was two;
    </p>
    <ol type="1">
      <li>bashblog had not been updated in almost 3 years</li>
      <li>I wanted features that was not part of the original project</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Out of these two reasons bashblog-ng was born. A drop-in replacement for
      bashblog with more features but still minimalstic.
    </p>
    <p>–</p>
    <p>
      Bashblog was created out of the necessity of a very, very simple way to
      post entries to a blog by using a public folder [on my server], without
      any special requirements and dependencies. Works on GNU/Linux, OSX and
      BSD.
    </p>
    <p>How simple? Just type ‘./bb.sh post’ and start writing your blogpost.</p>
    <p>Features:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Ultra simple usage: Just type a post with your favorite editor and the
        script does the rest. No templating.
      </li>
      <li>No installation required. Download bb.sh and start blogging.</li>
      <li>
        Zero dependencies. It runs just on base utils (date, basename, grep,
        sed, head, etc)
      </li>
      <li>
        GNU/Linux, BSD and OSX compatible out of the box, no need for GNU
        coreutils on a Mac. It does some magic to autodetect which command
        switches it needs to run depending on your system.
      </li>
      <li>
        All content is static. You only need shell access to a machine with a
        public web folder. Tip: advanced users could mount a remote public
        folder via ftpfs and run this script locally
      </li>
      <li>
        Allows drafts, includes a simple but clean stylesheet, generates the RSS
        file automatically.
      </li>
      <li>Support for tags/categories</li>
      <li>
        Support for Markdown, Disqus, Twitter, Feedburner, Google Analytics.
      </li>
      <li>
        The project is still maintained as of 2016. Bugs are fixed, and new
        features are considered (see “Contributing”)
      </li>
      <li>
        Everything stored in a single ~1k lines bash script, how cool is that?!
        ;)
