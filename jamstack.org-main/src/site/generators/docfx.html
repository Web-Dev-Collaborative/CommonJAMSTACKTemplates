      DocFX is an API documentation generator for .NET, and currently it
      supports C# and VB. It generates API reference documentation from
      triple-slash comments in your source code. It also allows you to use
      Markdown files to create additional topics such as tutorials and how-tos,
      and to customize the generated reference documentation. DocFX builds a
      static HTML website from your source code and Markdown files, which can be
      easily hosted on any web servers (for example, github.io). Also, DocFX
      provides you the flexibility to customize the layout and style of your
      website through templates. If you are interested in creating your own
      website with your own styles, you can follow how to create custom template
