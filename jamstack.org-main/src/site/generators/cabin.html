      Cabinâ€™s goal is to be a static site generator that encourages designers
      and developers to make themes and share them with the open source
      community. We want to make it easy to create and install themes so that
      theme authors can focus on developing themes, and users can quickly get up
      and running with their static sites.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cabin should be usable by everyone who knows how to edit markdown,
      templates, and css. At the same time, we want to provide support for Grunt
      power users and evolve with the Grunt ecosystem. As such, we plan on
      having a minimal default Gruntfile and providing options for power users
      to scaffold a more advanced Gruntfile.
