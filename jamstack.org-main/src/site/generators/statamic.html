<p>Statamic is a transformer. It adapts to your needs, growing with you and your site.</p>
<ul>
<li>There’s no database until you need one.</li>
<li>It’s a front-to-back CMS until you need to go headless.</li>
<li>It’s dynamically powered by PHP &amp; Laravel until you need to go static.</li>
<li>It’s full-stack until you go Jamstack.</li>
<li>Host it on any PHP7 server until you want to go serverless.</li>
<li>Use the beautiful control panel unless you don’t feel like it. Everything can be edited in your code editor.</li>
<li>You can version control everything unless you don’t want to.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="statamics-architecture">Statamic’s Architecture</h2>
<p>Statamic 3 is built as a highly extendable, standalone capable, Laravel package. If you’re already a Laravel developer, you’ll feel right at home extending core features with Models, Service Providers, and Middleware. You can even drop it into existing Laravel applications to add a full CMS in seconds. But you do not need to know Laravel or PHP to use Statamic. The control panel is built with Vue.js and can be customized with your own JavaScript or third-party addons. Fieldtypes and filters have access to data through Vuex. Build Widgets to power any dashboard you can imagine. Or just let it do its thing because it’s already pretty great.</p>
