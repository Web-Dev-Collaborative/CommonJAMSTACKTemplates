<p><code>tumblelog</code> is a simple static site generator with the focus on generating a rich and complete tumblelog or micro blog with various ways to navigate to archived blog posts. <code>tumblelog</code> comes with several styles and it’s easy to either modify an existing one or create your own.</p>
<p>The input is a single “Markdown” file divided into pages by starting a line with a date followed by a title. Each date page can further be split up into multiple articles using a single % on a line by itself.</p>
<p>Parameters to control the blog are given via command line arguments. The program creates the blog HTML5 pages and both a JSON and RSS feed.</p>
<p>The home page has extensive documentation on how to get started and how to have your own blog or site up in a very short time.</p>
