      simple-website is a static site generator written in Go. It takes Markdown
      as input, and gives you a static, simple, and responsive website as
      output. Posts and pages are supported.
    </p>
    <p>
      simple-website has been designed with technical simplicity and readability
      in mind – there are no configuration options and no themes to choose from.
      The workflow is simple – initialize a website using
      <code>simple-website</code>, create and/or edit Markdown files, run
      <code>simple-website</code> again – and publish.
