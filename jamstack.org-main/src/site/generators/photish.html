      Photish is a simple, convention based (but configurable) static photo site
      generator. Photish allows you to group your photo collections by folder.
      Metadata can be written alongside the photo in a
      <a href="http://yaml.org/">YAML</a> file with the same name as the photo.
    </p>
    <p>
      Photish will crawl through your directory of photos and metadata, and
      render the information in your website templates. Photish supports all
      template engines implemented by
      <a href="https://github.com/rtomayko/tilt">Tilt</a> (currently over 30
      formats). It will also read your configuration and automatically convert
      your images to your configured size, dimensions, colourscheme, etc using
      <a href="http://www.imagemagick.org/script/index.php">ImageMagick</a>.
      Using this information, Photish creates a complete static website that can
      be hosted on an <a href="http://nginx.org/">NGINX</a>,
      <a href="https://httpd.apache.org/">Apache HTTP Server</a>, or even on
      <a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Photish has been created with speed and efficiency in mind. Threads are
      used to parallelize image transcoding to achieve maximum utilization of
      your CPU during generation. A cache file is then used to ensure that
      unless the image has changed, it is not needlessly regenerated. This
      results in a responsive and fast local development environment, making it
      easy to perfect the design of your photo based website without having to
      wait for regeneration.
