    <p>
      Elder.js was designed from the ground up by a small team of SEOs and
      developers to solve the unique challenges and complexities of building
      flagship SEO sites with 10-100k+ pages.

          ><strong>Build hooks</strong></a
        >
        allow you to plug into any part of entire page generation process and
        build process and customize as needed.

      <li>
        <strong>A Highly Optimized Build Process:</strong> that will span as
        many CPU cores as you can throw at it to make building your site as fast
        as possible. For reference Elder.js easily generates a data intensive
        18,000 page site in 8 minutes using a budget 4 core VM.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Straightforward Data Flow:</strong> By simply associating a
        <code>data.js</code> file with your route, you have complete control
        over how you fetch, prepare, and manipulate data before sending it to
        your Svelte template. Anything you can do in Node.js, you can do to
        fetch your data. Multiple data sources, no problem.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Partial Hydration:</strong> Only hydrate the client with what
        needs to be interactive using partial hydration. This allows you to ship
        less data to the browser but still get all of the Svelte interactive
        goodness you love.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Community Plugins:</strong> Easily extend what your Elder.js
        site can do by adding
        <a href="https://github.com/Elderjs/plugins">prebuilt plugins</a> to
        your site.
      </li>
