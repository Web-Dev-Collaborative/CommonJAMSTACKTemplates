      Webby is a fantastic little website management system. It would be called
      a content management system if it were a bigger kid. But, it’s just a runt
      with a special knack for transforming text. And that’s really all it does
      – manages the legwork of turning text into something else, an ASCII
      Alchemist if you will.

      Webby works by combining the contents of a page with a layout to produce
      HTML. The layout contains everything common to all the pages – HTML
      headers, navigation menu, footer, etc. – and the page contains just the
      information for that page. You can use your favorite markup language to
      write your pages; Webby supports quite a few.
