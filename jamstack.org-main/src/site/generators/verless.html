<p>verless (pronounced like serverless) is a Static Site Generator designed for Markdown-based content with focus on simplicity and performance. It reads your Markdown files, applies your HTML templates and renders them as a website.</p>
<h3 id="flexible-theming">Flexible theming</h3>
<p>Themes define the HTML templates as well as styles and scripts for your frontend. Initializing a new theme can be done within a single command, and setting it as active requires a single line of configuration. Since verless provides pre-defined template variables, themes are interchangeable.</p>
<h3 id="rapid-development">Rapid development</h3>
<p>Just like themes, new projects can be created using a single command. Local development requires no third-party webserver as verless comes with a built-in webserver and rebuilds your project when something changes.</p>
<h3 id="high-performance">High performance</h3>
<p>Generating a static site typically is a matter of milliseconds. To keep build times short, verless lets you choose and explicitly enable features you need - only generate RSS feeds or overview pages for tags if you want to.</p>
<h3 id="focus-on-simplicity">Focus on simplicity</h3>
<p>Global information, page types, plugins and other settings are configured in a central configuration file inside your project. We try to keep things small and simple, and if your project isn’t simple, verless probably isn’t a good fit.</p>
