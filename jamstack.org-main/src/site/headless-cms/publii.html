<p>Unlike static-site generators that are often unwieldy and difficult to use, Publii provides an easy-to-understand UI much like server-based CMSs such as WordPress or Joomla!, where users can create posts and other site content, and style their site using a variety of built-in themes and options. Users can enjoy the benefits of a super-fast and secure static website, with all the convenience that a CMS provides.</p>
<p>What makes Publii even more unique is that the app runs locally on your desktop rather than on the siteâ€™s server. Available for Windows, Mac, Linux once the app has been installed you can create a site in minutes, even without internet access; since Publii is a desktop app you can create, update and modify your site offline, then upload the site changes to your server at the click of a button. Publii supports multiple upload options, including standard HTTP/HTTPS servers, Netlify, Amazon S3, GitHub Pages and Google Cloud or SFTP.</p>
