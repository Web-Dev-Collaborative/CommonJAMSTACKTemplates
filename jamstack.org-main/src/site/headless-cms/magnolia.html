<h1 id="a-headless-cms-thats-as-great-for-content-authors-as-it-is-for-developers.">A headless CMS that‚Äôs as great for content authors as it is for developers.</h1>
<p>Magnolia gives you the tools to empower content authors. (And make them happy! üòÉ)</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Content apps</strong> provide standard form-based content editing (as you know from every headless CMS.)</li>
<li><strong>Visual SPA Editor</strong> allows authors to work directly in the experience with a WYSIWYG ‚Äúpage builder‚Äù. (But don‚Äôt worry, it still delivers structured content over endpoints!)</li>
<li><strong>Trees</strong> Intrinsic support for hierarchies of content. Everyone understands trees.</li>
<li><strong>IUX</strong> (Integrated User Experience) allows you to surface content, information and controls from other systems directly into the Magnolia authoring UI. It gives authors the tools they need, right where and when they need it.</li>
<li><strong>Connectors and deep integration</strong> capabilities, it‚Äôs the foundation of Magnolia, and what makes it so good for taking a <em>Best of Breed</em> approach.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="power-and-speed">Power <em>and</em> Speed</h3>
<p>In the crowded CMS landscape, we think that Magnolia is different. With its enterprise heritage, it has the power of the big DXP‚Äôs like Sitecore and AEM. Yet, we‚Äôve honed the developer experience to make a product that is fast and light, like you expect from a modern Headless CMS. We call it <a href="https://hd.magnolia-cms.com/docs/concepts/light-development">Light Development</a>.</p>
<p>Magnolia is not an over-packed suite, it‚Äôs modular. Just use the parts you need. And use our <a href="https://hd.magnolia-cms.com/docs/concepts/integration">comprehensive extension points</a> and <a href="https://marketplace.magnolia-cms.com">connector packs</a> to integrate to your other tools and systems.</p>
<h3 id="for-developers-and-marketers">For Developers and marketers</h3>
<p>The <strong>Visual SPA Editor</strong> is a great collaboration system for devs and authors. It brings the components concept of <em>CMS</em> together with the component concept of <em>Frontend Frameworks</em> in a neat way. And it lets authors do more then just fill in disconnected forms, like most headless CMS.</p>
<p><img class="simple" src="/img/cms/magnolia-spa-editing.jpg" alt="Visual SPA Editor - WYSIWYG page editing for marketers" /></p>
<p>You can look at it as the developer putting ‚Äò<em>handles</em>‚Äô and ‚Äò<em>knobs</em>‚Äô on frontend components - so that marketers and content authors can move them around and tune them with custom content.</p>
<p>Once a developer provisions them, authors can go to town. And since the SPA is now way more flexible, developers don‚Äôt need to constantly maintain it after launch. Authors and marketers can do that themselves now.</p>
