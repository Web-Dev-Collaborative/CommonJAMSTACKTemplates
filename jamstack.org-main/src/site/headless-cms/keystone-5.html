    <p>
      <a href="https://v5.keystonejs.com/">Keystone 5</a> is a scalable platform
      that allows you to create a highly customised CMS and API in minutes.
    </p>
    <p>
      It’s not just a new version of Keystone, but a complete re-imagining of
      KeystoneJS for the future.
    </p>
    <p>
      Keystone 5 focuses on what we believe are the most powerful features for
      modern web and mobile applications.That means less focus on
      template-driven websites and more focus on a flexible architecture with a
      powerful GraphQL API.
    </p>
    <p>
      We believe it’s the ideal back-end for static websites using frameworks
      like React, Vue or Angular, Or Static site generators like Gatsby, Hugo,
      Jekyll or 11ty.
    </p>
    <h2 id="open-source">Open source</h2>
    <p>
      Keystone is proudly open-source and allows individual and commercial reuse
      and modification. The code is freely available on
      <a href="https://github.com/keystonejs/keystone-5">GitHub</a>.
    </p>
    <h2 id="configurable">Configurable</h2>
    <p>Configure a highly customised CMS and API in minutes.</p>
    <h2 id="zero-assumptions">Zero assumptions</h2>
    <p>
      Keystone is not opinionated about your front-end architecture. It works
      great with React, Vue, Angular, or anything else you like to use.
    </p>
    <p>
      Keystone also tries to make zero assumptions about your data structure
      allowing you to build any type of application. It achieves flexibility
      through small, highly composable parts that allow you to build a
      foundation for any application.
    </p>
    <p>
      Don’t need ‘Users’ or ‘Posts’? Not a problem! Keystone’s extensible
      architecture means you choose the features you need. Pick an ideal
      starting point, rather than working hard to adapt an opinionated
      framework.
    </p>
    <h2 id="fully-featured">Fully featured</h2>
    <p>
      Zero assumptions doesn’t mean zero features. Keystone comes with dozens of
      features out of the box including Lists, Fields, Access Control,
      Authentication, and Apps. You can add and configure each these, as well as
      extend, modify or build your own.
    </p>
    <h3 id="lists">Lists</h3>
    <p>
      Lists define a set of Fields that make up a collection in Keystone. A List
      might represent a content type, such as a “Page” or “Post”, but they can
      be any collection of data. Creating a List is how you define the data
      structure of your application.
    </p>
    <h3 id="fields">Fields</h3>
    <p>
      Fields represent a data type. They are used in Keystone for everything
      from rendering components in the Admin UI, to configuring Access Controls,
      to generating a GraphQL API. Keystone has dozens of built-in Field types
      and as always, you can create your own.
    </p>
    <h3 id="access-control">Access Control</h3>
    <p>
      Keystone has powerful Access controls that can be configured on Lists and
      Fields to define the specific actions authenticated and anonymous users
      can take within the Admin UI or GraphQL Apps.
    </p>
    <h3 id="authentication">Authentication</h3>
    <p>
      Authentication refers to a user identifying themselves and “logging in” to
      an application. Keystone provides multiple authentication strategies
      including a basic password or third-party authentication services, such as
      Twitter and Google.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once again, authentication strategies are configurable and extensible
      allowing you to create your own login methods.
    </p>
    <h3 id="apps">Apps</h3>
    <p>
      Keystone uses Apps to compose high-level features into a larger
      application. Essential Keystone Apps include the GraphQL App, Admin UI
      App, and Static App.
    </p>
    <h4 id="graphql-app">GraphQL App</h4>
    <p>
      The GraphQL App is the keystone App of KeystoneJS. It provides a powerful
      GraphQL API with CRUD operations and powerful filtering options for all
      your lists.
    </p>
    <h4 id="admin-ui-app">Admin UI App</h4>
    <p>
      The Admin App is a fully functional administration UI to help you manage
      your data.
    </p>
    <h4 id="static-app">Static App</h4>
    <p>
      The Static App allows you to serve content from a folder using an express
      static server. This can be quick and easy way to deploy a simple front-end
      with a Keystone application.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Static App, along with other Keystone Apps, can decoupled from the
      main application and deployed separately if required.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Note</em>: Apps like the Static App provides an alternative to
      Keystone 4’s views and templates engine.
    </p>
    <h2 id="self-host">Self host</h2>
    <p>
      Own your own data and host Keystone anywhere. Have complete freedom of
      choice when hosting your data, admin application, API and front-end
      applications.
    </p>
    <h2 id="headless">Headless</h2>
    <p>
      Keystone is headless, meaning it requires no front-end application.
      Keystone 5’s primary focus is on the API and Admin UI. It is
      non-prescriptive about your front-end application. Because of this
      Keystone 5 works with all major front-end frameworks.
    </p>
    <h2 id="choose-your-storage-methods">Choose your storage methods</h2>
    <p>
      Keystone allows you to choose different storage methods. Adapters for
      MongoDB and Postgres are available now, with additional adapters in
      development.
    </p>
    <p>
      Because of its extensible architecture, Keystone is not even explicitly
      tied to a database. You could create adapters for file-system storage such
      as SQLite or even JSON and cloud storage options. We hope to see many more
      adapter options in the future.
    </p>
    <p>
      Field level adapters allow you to fetch or store data for specific fields
      separately from your main storage location. Examples include uploading
      images to Cloudinary or fetching information via o-embed links.
    </p>
    <h2 id="get-started">Get started</h2>
    <p>
      Keystone has a high level of configurability when you need it, but most
      customisations are opt-in and Keystone provides sensible defaults to help
      you get started quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Create your first Keystone 5 project in seconds with the Keystone CLI.
