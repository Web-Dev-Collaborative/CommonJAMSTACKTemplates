      Power your apps and websites from Trello
    </h1>
    <p>
      <strong>Troglio</strong> turns any Trello board into a headless
      <strong>CMS</strong> : connect any site or app to manage its content from
      Trello cards.
    </p>
    <p>
      Writers can write using <strong>markdown</strong>,
      <strong>TOML</strong> or the Custom Fields Power-up to author their
      content from anywhere, <strong>even offline !</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Developers can use data as they please without being tied to a provider or
      a database.
    </p>
    <p>
      This results in amazing collaborations between authors and developers
      offering literally no limits to what can be built.
    </p>
    <h1 id="features">Features</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Connect with any of <strong>Github</strong>, <strong>Gitlab</strong>,
        <strong>Bibucket</strong> or connect to any
        <strong>custom endpoint accepting POST</strong>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Master configs</strong>: propagate default properties across
        cards from one central place. No need to repeat properties over and over
        again and make mass changes from one place.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Previews</strong>: after a small change in your templates logic,
        Troglio helps generating live previews right from Trello cards.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Supports 19 languages</strong> but developers only get english
        keywords as data. (i.e: users can use <code>type</code> or
        <code>类型</code> indiferently, developers will always get the value
        under the property in its english form <code>type</code>)
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Common properties out of the box</strong>: <code>title</code>,
        <code>type</code>, <code>template</code>, <code>layout</code>,
        <code>published</code>, <code>permalink</code>, <code>slug</code>…
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Customizable permalinks</strong>: content is affected an URL
        based on customizable permalinks rules simplifying routing a lot !
      </li>
      <li>
        Kinds:
        <strong>cards automatically inherits a <code>kind</code></strong>
        between any of <code>single</code>, <code>list</code> or
        <code>home</code>. This is very handy to adapt templates. (inspired from
        <code>Hugo</code> static site generator)
      </li>
      <li><strong>Add custom fields</strong> to fill templates</li>
      <li>
        <strong>Group data from other cards</strong>: using the
        <code>add</code> property, it is possible to attach several cards
        content into another one.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p><em>Why Trello ?</em></p>
    <p>
      Trello is a simple collaboration tool really intuitive to organize ideas
      into lists, brainstorm, follow projects and more. This simplicity makes
      editing content a breeze for authors: they have a really neat and broad
      vision of their content in a single board. Plus, an important point to
      note is that Trello is available in any smartphone and
      <strong>works offline</strong> !! This means authors can edit content from
      anywhere literally.
    </p>
    <p><em>Why use Troglio instead of Trello’s API ?</em></p>
    <p>
      Troglio comes with all the tools you expect from a classic CMS: custom
      types, publish/draft logic, template override… and even live previews !
      Using TOML, authors can enrich content with more structured data leading
      to endless possibilities. Finally, the most important part of Troglio is
      that it is an opninionated framework to manage apps and websites content
      from Trello: it removes the need for each developers to think about
      implementation details and Troglio helps get started right away. Examples,
      tutorials, starters, support… are all the benefits given from having a
      common framework to work with instead of being isolated :) Don’t be shy
      and help us enhance Troglio’s experience by submitting an issue in

    <h1 id="get-started">Get started</h1>
    <p>
      <strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> Troglio is an indpendant power-up and thus has
      to be installed manually as a custom power-up:
      <strong>it is not available in the public listings of Trello</strong>,
