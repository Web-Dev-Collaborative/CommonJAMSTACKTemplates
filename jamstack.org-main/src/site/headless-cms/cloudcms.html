      around JSON and a high performance cloud architecture. It delivers
      enterprise features, including flexible content models and a full
      editorial environment, allowing your business users create, manage and
      publish fresh content with ease.

      Cloud CMS is available either as a hosted subscription or as a series of
      Docker microservices that you can run on-premise or host within your own
      private cloud. Cloud CMS runs on top of MongoDB, ElasticSearch and Amazon
      AWS.
