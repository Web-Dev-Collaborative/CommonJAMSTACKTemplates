      At Flotiq we strongly believe in open standards as a way to enable
      development of well-engineered systems. The Content Types you create in
      Flotiq are automatically translated into a set of RESTful endpoints and
      Flotiq provides an OpenAPI schema, that updates automatically after every
      change you make to your data models. That schema is then used for
      generating your SDKs and API docs.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you’re not feeling like building your own Content type, you can always
      use one of our boilerplates. If you do - you’ll find a boilerplate repo on
      Github, that will let you deploy your own {blog, portfolio, calendar,
      e-commerce, recipe page} in under 5 minutes.
    </p>
    <p>Don’t take our word on it - check yourself.</p>

      Once you have defined your data model - you can start working with your
      content. You don’t need to learn Flotiq’s API, because there isn’t any.
      Flotiq lets you define your API yourself, so you can feel comfortable with
      the models and properties you define. To simplify your Developer
      Experience we provide SDKs that fully integrate with your IDE, so you will
      get all the auto-complete magic you’d ever need!

    <h3 id="scoped-api-keys">Scoped API keys</h3>
    <p>
      The recently added scoped API keys are a perfect way to keep your API
      secure. You can create keys for individual endpoints or group them by use
      case, whatever works for you.

    <h3 id="powerful-search-api">Powerful search API</h3>
    <p>
      Unlike other headless CMS systems - we believe that developers need
      efficient access to content. So we’re not only exposing the content
      through REST endpoints, but also providing efficient means of searching
      through that content. To provide one of the most powerful ways to query
      content - we partially expose the ElasticSearch (ES) engine through
      Flotiq’s search API, wrapping it and stripping to leave only the
      essentials.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can aggregate your search results by given conditions and also rank
      them by giving weight to a specific field. Be sure to check our
