      Scrivito is a user friendly, secure and serverless JavaScript SaaS CMS –
      built for digital agencies and medium to large sized businesses.
    </p>
    <p>
      Its backend is API-driven and running on AWS, but it comes with a
      beautiful ReactJS SDK to render pages client-side in the browser.
    </p>
    <p>
      Based on ReactJS, Scrivito is completely maintenance-free, cost-effective,
      and has unprecedented security. It combines unmatched WYSIWYG usability
      for editors with maximum flexibility for developers.
    </p>
    <p>
      And because Scrivito renders all pages client-side, it is 100% serverless,
      you’ll never have to patch your CMS, so it’s the most secure and
      cost-effective solution on the market.

    <h3 id="maintenance-free">100% maintenance free</h3>
    <p>
      And CTOs love our reliability – because we eliminate the need for constant
      patching, thanks to our scalable, secure serverless and 100%
      maintenance-free approach. All pages are rendered in the browser, no
      server required. The JS hosting is integrated with Netlify.
    </p>
    <h3 id="built-for-reactjs">Built for ReactJS</h3>
    <p>
      Developers love our flexibility – because Scrivito is 100% JavaScript, it
      is at the forefront of the current JavaScript web development revolution -
      leveraging cutting-edge technologies like client-side rendering and
      Facebook’s ReactJS.
    </p>
    <h3 id="wysiwyg-editing">WYSIWYG editing</h3>
    <p>
      Editors love our usability – because our WYSIWYG editing lets them place
      content and widgets directly on the pages using drag-and-drop, exactly
      where they want it. This is where all other headless CMS lack. So call
      Scrivito a headless CMS, but with a head.
