<p>BowTie professional site builder. Build fast and lean websites for your clients that don’t skimp on features.</p>
<h3 id="simple-sites-are-better-sites">Simple Sites are Better Sites</h3>
<p>Database-driven websites expose your clients to security risks, and often require complex optimization and maintenance.</p>
<p>BowTie helps you deploy websites that are faster, easier to maintain, and more secure than a traditional content management system - without losing convenience.</p>
<h3 id="dynamic-features">Dynamic Features</h3>
<p>The benefits of a static site – enhanced to make content creation, and project maintenance easy.</p>
<p>BowTie gives you Stripe Payments, User Management, Zapier, and a Hosted Content Editor without a database.</p>
<h3 id="let-them-do-the-editing">Let Them Do the Editing</h3>
<p>Handing off content creation? Clients and non-technical collaborators can use a customized editor to modify only what they need to.</p>
<p>Developers can manage access to content, roll back changes with git version control, and work locally with familiar tools.</p>
<h3 id="worry-free-websites">Worry Free Websites</h3>
<p>Database driven legacy sites are needlessly complex and susceptible to known exploits – and we all pay the price.</p>
<p>BowTie captures information (behavior, payments, custom data) securely when you need persistent data. There’s no software to maintain, and no database to hack.</p>
<h3 id="time-saved-for-visitors-and-clients">Time Saved for Visitors and Clients</h3>
<p>Deliver lightning fast content to your visitors, on secure, scalable cloud infrastructure.</p>
<p>Use our template framework to produce brochures, donation sites, or simple e-commerce sites quickly – allowing you to focus on what matters, design and content.</p>
