    <h3 id="graphql">GraphQL</h3>
    <p>
      The Content Delivery API is written in GraphQL, which offers a number of
      advantages over classic REST APIs: - Strongly typed schema - No more
      over-fetching and under-fetching - Fewer roundtrips

    <p>
      Plugins aim to provide an amazing experience for DatoCMS editors, by
      letting developers replace the default fields that DatoCMS provides with
      third-party HTML5 applications, so the editing experience of every DatoCMS
      project can be fully customized.

    <h3 id="features">Features</h3>
    <h4 id="modular-content">Modular content</h4>
    <p>
      Rich text fields, images, geopoints, complex relationships, SEO/social
      sharing settings… DatoCMS makes it easy to build a tailored authoring
      experience for your editors and marketers. Create any kind of object —
      pages, products, case studies. Just drag and drop fields into your model
      and everything will be instantly editable.
    </p>
    <h4 id="powerful-image-manipulation">Powerful image manipulation</h4>
    <p>
      Every DatoCMS plan comes with the power of Imgix, a extremely powerful and
      fast CDN that allows you to perform any kind of manipulation to the
      uploaded assets. Optimize, resize, crop, rotate and watermark images
      on-the-fly simply adding custom parameters to the URL of your image.
    </p>
    <h4 id="dynamic-layouts">Dynamic layouts</h4>
    <p>
      With DatoCMS you can achieve structured, rich-content editing using a
      specific type of field called Modular Content. Give your authors the
      freedom to compose inspiring visual stories by alternating a number of
      reusable custom components without depending on the development team.
    </p>
    <h4 id="whitelabel">100% Whitelabel</h4>
    <p>
      Customize theme colors, logo, custom domain.. you can easily setup DatoCMS
      to match your — or your clients’ — brand identity. We don’t want to get in
      the way: your editors will hardly notice the presence of a third-party
      CMS.
    </p>
    <h4 id="multi-language">Multi-language</h4>
    <p>
      DatoCMS offers full localization support. All your content types and
      assets can be localizable, including rich text, images, geopoints and
      especially your URLs.
    </p>
    <h4 id="tree-like-structures">Tree-like structures</h4>
    <p>
      Taxonomies, product categories, navigation bars… websites are full of
      hierarchical data. DatoCMS is the only headless CMS that supports
      tree-like data structures out-of-the-box, offering a delightful editing
      experience for your editors and marketers.
    </p>
    <h4 id="single-instance-models">Single instance models</h4>
    <p>
      Most headless CMS solutions only allow the creation of collections of
      objects (ie. articles, case studies, etc.), but websites often have pages
      that don’t resemble any other — eg. the “About us” page, or even the
      homepage. If you want to allow your editors to manage their content, in
      DatoCMS you can create what we call single instance models.
    </p>
    <h4 id="customizable-navigation-bar">Customizable navigation bar</h4>
    <p>
      When your website gets bigger, the number of models in your administrative
      area will grow as well, so for editors it might quickly become difficult
      to understand which part of the backend is linked to which part of the
      frontend website. With DatoCMS you can easily organize the navigation bar
      of your administrative area: group, rename and reorder menu items so that
      their purpose will be more clear to your editors.
    </p>
    <h4 id="user-roles">User roles</h4>
    <p>
      Simply put, DatoCMS offers the most thorough roles/permissions system you
      can find in the headless CMS market. Build the perfect publication
      workflow for your team, precisely determining what actions every team
      member can perform inside the administrative area (ie. “user has read-only
      permissions on every content, except for articles which can be freely
      created/updated but not deleted nor published online”).
    </p>
    <h4 id="revision-history">Revision History</h4>
    <p>
      Never lose a change thanks to revision history: DatoCMS keeps track of all
      drafts and publications of your content, in a simple concise view,
      displayed together with the change date and its author. DatoCMS offers a
      powerful diff visualization of changes between content revisions. Preview
      what has changed not only in rich text, but also in images, links,
      geopoints, and every other rich fragment.
    </p>
    <h4 id="search-engine">Search engine</h4>
    <p>
      If you’re using DatoCMS to build a static website, you’ll be happy to know
      that we support an easy way to offer to your website visitors site-wide
      search functionality at no additional cost. You can think of DatoCMS
      Search as a replacement for the now discontinued Google Site Search: just
      add our themable Javascript widget, we’ll take care of the rest.
    </p>
    <h4 id="strong-consistent-api">Strong consistent API</h4>
    <p>
      DatoCMS offers an all-encompassing, strong API you can rely on to build
      scripts and automate anything. A subtle, but fundamental difference from
      other competitors is that we offer immediate consistency instead of
      eventual consistency: this means that your actions will always be
      predictable — an especially important property to have during
      import/export of data.
    </p>
    <h4 id="security">Security</h4>
    <p>
      We take the security of our users very seriously. Both the administrative
      area and the API run on HTTPS, we have continuous data protection in
      place, and you can even enforce two-factor authentication to your editors
      using the Google Authenticator app.
