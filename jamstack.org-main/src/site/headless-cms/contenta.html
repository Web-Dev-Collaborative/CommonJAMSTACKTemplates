<p>Contenta is the community driven API distribution for Drupal 8, and provides the robustness and flexibility of Drupal in a friendly API-first package.</p>
<p>It provides a standard platform that is API ready along with demo content and example front-end applications. Contenta intends to ease the pain of using, or simply trying, decoupled Drupal.</p>
<h2 id="free-open-source-software-to-be-hosted-anywhere">Free Open Source Software to be hosted anywhere</h2>
<p>Contenta is based off of Drupal, which is a powerful, robust content management system built on object-oriented PHP. Drupal runs websites such as whitehouse.gov, grammy.com, harvard.edu, and millions more.</p>
<h2 id="api-ready-with-excellent-documentation.">API ready with excellent documentation.</h2>
<p>A HTTP API is provided ready to use with full auto-generated documentation, and a Contenta knowledge hub is manually curated to provide a list of excellent resources on decoupled Drupal.</p>
<h2 id="example-and-open-source-api-consumers">Example (and Open Source) API Consumers</h2>
<p>Many example consumers in different technologies such as Angular, Elm, React, Ember, Ionic, and Vue show you how easy is to build a Contenta project.</p>
