      Directus is an open-source suite of software that provides an instant API
      wrapper for SQL databases and an intuitive Admin App for non-technical
      users to manage that content. It’s like a safe, friendly, and
      super-powered “database client” (eg: <em>PHP-my-Admin</em> or
      <em>Sequel Pro</em>). Created in 2004, our premium platform powers
      hundreds-of-thousands of data-driven applications around the world. With
      our JSON API, webhooks, and complete control over where and how your
      content is used — what will you build with Directus?

    <h2 id="database-first">Database-First</h2>
    <p>
      Directus follows a database-first approach, storing all of your data
      <em>unaltered</em> in pure SQL databases with that can be completely
      cusotmized. Benefits to this approach include:
    </p>
    <h3 id="portability-and-transparency">Portability and Transparency</h3>
    <p>
      Directus is <em>not</em> a black-box system. There is nothing proprietary
      or opinionated about how Directus stores your content so you’re never
      locked-in or locked out. Import existing SQL to get started quickly, and
      rest assured that you can also export your unaltered content as vanilla
      SQL at any point. You can also self-host the entire suite on your own
      servers if needed or use our hosted Cloud service.
    </p>
    <h3 id="access-and-optimization">Access and Optimization</h3>
    <p>
      Directus mirrors <em>your</em> actual database so it will automatically
      stay in sync with any changes made directly to the database! With the full
      power of SQL unlocked, you can:
    </p>
    <ol type="1">
      <li>
        Architect your actual database with meaningful table and column names
      </li>
      <li>
        Infinitely optimize with indexing, datatypes, lengths, defaults, keys,
        encoding, etc
      </li>
      <li>
        Update your database schema at any point and Directus will instantly
        reflect changes
      </li>
      <li>Create, update, and delete content directly from the database</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      This database-first approach means that you have the option to completely
      bypass Directus as needed. Connecting your application directly to the
      database means Directus is completely bypassed, removing even the
      slightest possibility of a bottleneck, and giving you the unbridled power
      of SQL.
    </p>
    <h3 id="complex-relationships">Complex Relationships</h3>
    <p>
      Whether you need many-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-many, or something
      completely different… Directus has you covered. You can interrelate
      database fields, then fetch deeply nested data using our robust
      dot-notation parameters.
    </p>
    <h2 id="simple-modular-and-extensible">Simple, Modular and Extensible</h2>
    <p>
      We’ve intentionally kept our codebase as simple and lightweight as
      possible. Every aspect of Directus has been modularized, with many options
      for extending, overriding, or even bypassing the core system. Choose your
      auth providers, storage adapters, content interfaces, data presentation,
      and more. We also have webhooks, event hooks, API response filters, custom
      endpoints, CSS/JS override files, and much more.
    </p>
    <h2 id="internationalization-and-accessibility">
      Internationalization and Accessibility
    </h2>
    <p>
      Directus allows you to manage multilingual content in as many languages as
      your project needs. And no matter what language(s) your organization
      requires, our Admin App supports a growing number of locales. We’ve also
      paid close attention to our Admin App’s interface to ensure it is as clear
      and accessible as possible for all users.
